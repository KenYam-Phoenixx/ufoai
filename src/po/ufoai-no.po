"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to "
"replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of "
"dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
"dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got "
"out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving "
"examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government "
"warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of "
"storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even "
"find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best "
"to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade "
"our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four "
"HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The "
"HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered "
"aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose. It can also carry "
"additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 light weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated "
"fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO "
"sighting.\n"

"Kommandant, jeg har gått over disse gamle filene før deg, og jeg har "
"besluttet å erstatte dem med mine egne vurderinger og konklusjoner om vårt "
"valg av transportfartøy. Beklager hvis jeg overskrider mine grenser, men de "
"gamle Falanks-transportflyene i lagring tilfredsstiller rett og slett ikke "
"moderne krav. Ingen av dem selv kom ut av prototypestadiet da de var nye. "
"Det er bare to bevarte eksempler, og begge disse skipene er blitt forlatt "
"nedpakket på lager de siste 60 årene, og er ikke verdt bryet med å de ta ut "
"av lagring. Vi har arvet et skikkelig rot med hensyn til utstyret, jeg kan "
"ikke engang finne halvparten av tingene som er ment å vente på oss. Jeg gjør "
"mitt beste for å finne overlegene alternativer for utstyr som bare ikke er "
"klar for oppgaven.\n"
"\n"
"Den lille flaksen i dette transportfartøyrotet er at jeg klarte å overtale "
"vår FN-representant om å øremerke deler av budsjettet til et nytt skip, og "
"jeg tror du vil like det.\n"
"\n"
"Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertikal Takeoff og Landing) er den beste flyet vi "
"kan håpe på å benytte i vår transportfartøy rolle. Det ble utformet som et "
"transportfly, men har raskt blitt plukket opp og tilpasset troppetransport "
"av militære entreprenører. Det har siden blitt et populært alternativ til "
"helikoptre både i den militære og sivile verden grunn av sine fire HM-5600 "
"pulsdetonasjonsmotorer, som gir Firebird sin VTOL-evne og oppnår god "
"drivstoffeffektivitet med langt færre bevegelige deler enn noen "
"helikoptermotor. Dette øker påliteligheten jevnt over og gir et vesentlig "
"raskere luftfartøy delvis grunnet mangel på rotorblader. HM-5600s er "
"imidlertid fortsatt svært tørste motorer, og det kraftige flydrivstoffet kan "
"bli for dyrt for sivile anvendelser. \n"
"\n"
"Firebirds marsjfart er Mach 0,74. Med en maksimal hastighet på Mach 1,03 kan "
"det bare såvidt skvise gjennom lydmuren, men dette fører til mye stress på "
"flyskroget og bør unngås utenfor nødssituasjoner. Den har et variabelt "
"våpenfeste plassert i nesen. Det kan også bære ekstra utstyr for å forbedre "
"sine flygeegenskaper og kamprelatert ytelse. Det er akselerasjonsseletøy for "
"opptil 8 soldater. \n"
"\n"
"Det er ingenting annet på himmelen som er så godt egnet for vår "
"transportfartøyrolle som Firebird. Det er raskere enn noen helikopter, mer "
"manøvrerbar enn noen fastvinget fly, og det kan reagere raskt og effektivt "
"mot trusler over hele verden.\n"
"\n"
"Firebird krever en stor hangar for oppbevaring, vedlikehold og anvendelse. "
"Den har en lett våpenfeste plassert i nesen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Anbefalt Lære\n"
"\n"
"Transportflyet er det som skal frakte våre tropper rundt om i verden, for å "
"svare på romvesenes angrep på bakken eller å rydde Ufo-krasjområder for "
"utvinning. Det bør innsettes øyeblikkelig i områder med romvesenaktivitet og "
"å berge nedskutte romvesenfartøyer.\n"
"\n"
"Selv bevæpnede Firebird-klasse transportfartøy er ikke i stand til å stå "
"imot dedikerte jagerfly, og det bør aldri bli sendt som eneste "
"avskjæringsjager mot Ufoer.\n"

"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 04 November 2026\n"
"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
"generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests "
"with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest "
"piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "
"speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air "
"channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and "
"redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They "
"are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can "
"hover unassisted for an extended period before burning through all their "
"fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "
"complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at "
"all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire "
"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"
"the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not "
"limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and "
"optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed "
"in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can "
"actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of "
"armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. "
"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
"Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its "
"maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within "
"this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
"recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
"described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 heavy wing "
"mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
"threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with "
"anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed "
"against distant targets as it won't have enough fuel for both attack "
"manoeuvres and the flight back to base.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but "
"the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for "
"us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race "
"is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
"person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
"little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they "
"held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most "
"manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and "
"can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern "
"aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at "
"speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. "
"However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can "
"handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track "
"down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being "
"restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight "
"testing on my own authority.\n"
"\n"
"This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. "
"We're going to need it."

"\n"
"Jeg er veldig glad for å rapportere at den første produksjonsmodellen av "
"vårt neste generasjons jagerfly er fullført og bestått alle flytester med "
"glans. Med fare for å høres skrytende, kan det være det fineste stykke "
"menneskelig teknologi som noensinne er produsert\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto er et enkeltseters luft herredømme kampfly med VTOL evne (Vertikal "
"TakeOff og Landing), slik at det å lande små landingsplattformer eller i "
"midten av ingensteds om nødvendig. De enorme og høyytelses turbovifter kan "
"snu 360 grader for full manøvrerbarhet selv ved supersoniske hastigheter. De "
"gigantiske motorinntakene er beskyttet av et avansert "
"luftkanaliseringssystem som aktivt filtrerer luften foran motoren og "
"omdirigeringer eventuelle materialstykker store nok til å skade "
"viftebladene. De er mer enn kraftig nok til å løfte den tungt pansrede "
"flykroppen og kan sveve uten assistanse for en lengre periode før den bruker "
"opp alt drivstoffet.\n"
"\n"
"Det helikopteretlignende designet der kanskje ikke veldig raskt ut, men "
"skinnet kan bedra. Stilettoens kompakte flyskrog kan overleve alt opp til "
"Mach 2 for kortere perioder; det har en marsjfart på Mach 1,3 og en maks "
"hastighet på 2,1 på etterbrennere. Disse gode karakterer setter Stiletto "
"godt i forkant av mange militære jagerfly som ikke har supersoniske evner.\n"
"\n"
"Når det først er i luften, kan det hoppe som en hare og er helt nådeløs i "
"hendene på en erfaren pilot. Det kan slå sidelengs rundt hangarkomplekset på "
"seks sekunder mens du holder nesen sitt maskingevær på målet hele tiden. Det "
"kan vippe ende-over-ende i 0.3 sekunder og få rakettlås på stealthfly før "
"svingen er fullført.\n"
"\n"
"Raketter er montert på våpenfester montert rett under ytre vingespenn. "
"Stiletto har også kraftige elektroniske krigføringsevner, med en toppmoderne "
"sensorpakke som finnes i nesen som inkluderer - men er ikke begrenset til - "
"flere målrettingslasere, et sofistikert radarsystem, og optisk "
"bildebehandling like kraftig som noen spionsatellitt. Små ECM-emittere "
"plassert på strategiske punkter på tvers av flykroppen vil forstyrre "
"rakettlåser og kan aktivt forstyrre innkommende radarer. Våpenets "
"våpenfester kan ta en rekke våpen, og elektronikken er fullt modulær for å "
"kunne ta oppgraderinger. Husk imidlertid at plassen i dette fartøyet er en "
"luksus.\n"
"\n"
"De kraftige Volkot VO-36 motorer bruker en stor mengde drivstoff, og "
"Stilettoens kapasitet er ikke stor. Med nok drivstoff for avskjæring er dens "
"maksimale effektive rekkevidden ikke er større enn 2000 kilometer. Men "
"innenfor denne radiusen er dette fartøyet herre over alt det undersøker.\n"
"\n"
"Vær oppmerksom på at på grunn av sin eksepsjonelle ytelse er dette fartøyet "
"ikke anbefalt brukt av uerfarne piloter. Dens håndtering ved lave "
"hastigheter har blitt beskrevet av våre testmannskaper som «kinkig».\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto krever en liten hangar for oppbevaring, vedlikehold og anvendelse. "
"Den har 3 våpenfester, et lite nesestativ og 2 tunge vingestativ.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Anbefalt Lære\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto er ideell for kortrekkende avskjæring av fiendtlige fartøyer som "
"truer Falanksbaser eller nærliggende sivile mål. Det kan gå tå til tå med "
"alt på jorden, og det vil vinne. Imidlertid kan Stiletto ikke settes inn mot "
"fjerne mål da det ikke vil ha nok drivstoff til både angrepsmanøvrer og "
"flyvningen tilbake til basen.\n"
"\n"
"Ytelse mot utenomjordisk farkost kan ikke måles, selvfølgelig, men det beste "
"vi kan gjøre er det beste vi kan gjøre. Hvis en virkelig fremmed trussel "
"kommer for oss i vår levetid og Stiletto ikke vil gjøre jobben, da er den "
"menneskelige rase i trøbbel.\n"

"papiret og i egen person, og det har sprengt tankene mine. Det er vanskelig "
"å tro vi bygget disse små tingene i 2026 - og at ingen noensinne innså hva "
"slags gull de holdt i sine hender før nå. Det vi har her er trolig det mest "
"manøvrerbare luftfartøyet som noensinne er bygget, det gjør "
"angrepshelikoptre til skamme og kan slå sirkler rundttoppmoderne jetfly. Det "
"gjør ting de fleste moderne fly ikke engang kan drømme om.\n"
"\n"
"Det er også et mareritt å fly på grunn av sin iboende ustabilitet, spesielt "
"i fart. Den originale filen undervurderer kraftig en del av den tekniske "
"vurderingen. Men Kommandant, al-Kuhar av luftfløyen insisterer på at våre "
"piloter kan håndtere det, og jeg tror jeg tror ham. Enda bedre, vi har klart "
"å spore opp et komplett intakt eksemplar, og det er på verksted akkurat nå "
"og blir restaurert til drift. Jeg har gitt klarsignal for en full ombygging "
"og flytesting ved min egen autoritet.\n"

"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
"and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts into weapons capacity. The "
"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "
"nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to "
"dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the "
"Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that "
"implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain "
"effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. "
"It has 2 medium weapon hardpoints.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
"extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed "
"by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of "
"the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the "
"aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be "
"measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat "
"encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able "
"to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"Det er klart at Stilettoklassejagerflyet, et kjempefint fly, ikke dekker "
"alle våre behov. Vi må være klare til å forsvare vår planet og vårt folk "
"overalt i hele verden. Stilettoens operative område er for begrenset, og det "
"er ikke rask nok til å engasjere alle Ufoer vi kan oppdage.\n"
"\n"
"Bare ett fly i verden er i stand til å fylle det operative gapet vi står "
"overfor, den argentinske KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, kalt «Saracen» i NATO-kode. "
"Det blander ny og gammel stealthteknologi i et enkelt flyskrog, Saracen "
"ligner mest på den gamle SR-71 «Blackbird» i sin form og skjoldfigur. Det er "
"svart som natten selv, dekket i strålingsabsorberende maling som gjør det "
"praktisk talt usynlig for radar, lidar og de fleste andre former for aktiv "
"skanning. Skroget består nesten utelukkende av karbon-nanorør og plater av "
"grafittforsterket plast. Dette gjør fartøyet ekstremt sterk og "
"varmebestandig nok til å takle temperaturer i hastigheter i overkant av Mach "
"4. Saracen er det raskeste militære fly som fremdeles flyr i dag.\n"
"\n"
"Når det gjelder sine evner skyver Saracen vårt avskjæringsområde til "
"internasjonalt område. Dets enorme og pansrede tanker og fantastiske "
"drivstoffeffektivitet tillater det å dra hvor som helst opptil 10.000 "
"kilometer fra dens hangar ved hypersoniske hastigheter - og tilbake igjen - "
"med drivstoff til overs for kampmanøvrer. Dens stealth-design, høye "
"hastighet og robuste flyskrog, tillater den å engasjere Ufoer som vår "
"Stilettoklasse-jagerfly ganske enkelt kan være ute av stand til å nå igjen. "
"Det har hard rustning og kan fly hjem selv på en motor. Takket være kraften "
"i motorene og et sett med ekstra manøvreringsrakettmotorer i buken kan det "
"ta av nesten loddrett, og det er definitivt innenfor de begrensninger i våre "
"hangaranlegg.\n"
"\n"
"Dens elektronikk pakke er like imponerende. Det har toppmoderne "
"målrettingsdatamaskiner, avansert radar- og lidarsystemer, avansert ECM-"
"utstyr (Elektroniske mottiltak), in-hjelm VR bildebehandling for piloten, "
"med mer.\n"
"\n"
"Dessverre, til tross for sine sterke sider, er det kostbart å leie og "
"vedlikeholde, og sin tunge last av drivstoff og rustning reduserer "
"våpenkapasiteten. Saracen kan ikke tilsvare våpenbelastningen til det langt "
"mindre og rimeligere Stiletto. Heller ikke kan det håpe på å tilsvare "
"Stilettoens manøvreringsevne. Til tross for sin skyvekraftvektorteknologi "
"(evnen til å endre formen på motordyser til direkte skyvekraft), "
"elektroelastiske vingeoverflate (evnen til å dynamisk endre formen på "
"vingene) og andre veldig gode fremskritt, er Saracen fortsatt et stort "
"fastvinget fly med alle de begrensningene det innebærer. Selv om det kan ta "
"mye mer skade enn en Stiletto og forbli effektivt, vil Saracen ikke gi så "
"gode resultater i kamp med fremmede fartøyer.\n"
"\n"
"Saracen krever en liten hangar for oppbevaring, vedlikehold og anvendelse. "
"Det har 2 middels store våpenfester.n\n"
"\n"
"Anbefalt Lære\n"
"\n"
"I sitt hjerte er Saracen en langtrekkende avskjæringsjager til å bli brukt "
"mot ekstremt fjerntliggende eller raske Ufoer. I motsetning til fremmede "
"fartøyer, blir det knapt sinket ved å bevege seg innenfor jordens atmosfære, "
"noe som gjør det litt raskere enn de fleste Ufoer vi har observert så langt. "
"Dette vil tillate Falanks å fange romvesener uansett hvor de kan gå - "
"unntatt interplanetarisk rom.\n"

"inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer "

"actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our "
"arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-"
"fighting mobility than alien designs.\n"
"\n"
"The three-pronged fuselage is also inspired by the enemy, slicing through "
"the air with remarkable grace. The upper two prongs can mount onboard "
"electronics to enhance evasion and targeting. Two heavy weapon hardpoints "
"are located in the center -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the "
"Dragon was named.\n"

"The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter "
"to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the "
"fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we "
"can't afford to spend it on anything but our airfleet. That's why we should "
"be careful about where we deploy the Dragon, and consider whether or not its "
"deployment is really necessary in any given situation.\n"

"orbit on its own steam, it has no space capabilities and should not be "

"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien expeditions. It "
"is frequently deployed to engage aerial targets or even as a diversion to "
"mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly "
"fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side "
"to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter "
"engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This "
"weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough "
"research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, "
"it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely "
"dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of "
"light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or "
"disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it "
"mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting "
"computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air "
"engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us "
"to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster "
"than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a "
"craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull "
"materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The "
"aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current "
"technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "
"armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few "
"tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to "
"be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO "
"does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will "
"not be enough to harm nearby craft.\n"

"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. However, their "
"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "
"than armed reconnaissance.\n"

"Kampflyet synes å tjene rollen som eskorte til utenomjordiske ekspedisjoner. "
"Det er ofte utplassert for å engasjere luftmål eller som en avledning for å "
"maskere enkelte andre oppdrag andre steder.\n"
"\n"
"Det er ikke så manøvrerbart som enkelte Ufoer vi har observert, men det er "
"absolutt raskt med et tøft flyskrog og store klolignende varmevekslere på "
"siden for å kompensere for den økte varmeeffekten på tykk "
"antimateriemotorer. Det monteres et enkelt våpensystem under nesen av "
"fartøyet. Dette våpenet, en slags høy-energi partikkelstråle vil kreve "
"grundige undersøkelser før vi vil være i stand til å trekke noen "
"konklusjoner. Imidlertid er det åpenbart fra våre kampopptak at dette "
"våpenet er ekstremt farlig. Det fyrer av en stråle av partikler ved en "
"brøkdel av lysets hastighet, som gir det betydelig bredde før atmosfæren kan "
"bremse-og/eller spre partiklene nok til å uskadeliggjøre disse.\n"
"\n"
"Kampflyet har ingen merkbare kommunikasjonsutstyr, heller ikke monterte "
"landingshjul. Hva det har er imidlertid en stor målrettingsdatamaskin og "
"holografiske HUD for å gjøre fartøyet enda mer effektiv i luft engasjement.\n"
"\n"
"Kombinert med vårt arbeid med Ufo-teori, har analysen av kampflyet ledet oss "
"til noen nye konklusjoner om disse mindre klasser av Ufoer. Mens det er "
"raskere enn de fleste ting på Jorden, er kampflyet fortsatt ikke veldig rask "
"for en farkost drevet av antimaterieraketter. Fra hva vi har sett av "
"utenomjordiske skrogmaterialer, kunne de lett motstå større "
"motorpåkjenninger ved behov. Romvesenene kan sikkert bygge mer kraftige "
"motorer med sin nåværende teknologi. Det synes som den begrensende faktoren "
"er drivstoffustabilitet.\n"
"\n"
"Antimaterietankene i kampflyet er svært små og svært tungt pansret. "
"Tydeligvis tar ikke romvesenene noen unødige sjanser. De få tidels gram av "
"antimaterie som en liten Ufo trygt kan bære synes å være akkurat nok til å "
"fullføre et planetoppdrag og returnere til basen. Hvis Ufoen mister "
"magnetfeltet vil mengden av antimaterie i tankene ikke være nok til å skade "
"nærliggende fartøy.\n"

"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "

"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"

"\n"
"This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien "

"purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry out "
"hideous operations on human victims.\n"
"\n"
"Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human "
"biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood "

"complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are "
"still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem to "

"treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these robots in "
"place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of air-drop "
"mechanism as well.\n"
"\n"
"It's difficult to speculate exactly what goes on in these UFOs with regards "
"to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with the alien "
"harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for that which do "
"not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to suspect that the "
"Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity on Earth. Something "
"has changed. Until we fully understand what's happening, we need to prepare "
"ourselves for what could be the worst threat to the global population we've "
"ever seen.\n"

"Der forrige romvesenutstyret syntes først og fremst å fokusere på å samle "
"menneskelig biomasse, korrupterens interiør - spesielt de massive "

"løpet av flyturen, og alkovene ser ut til å ha en form for luft-"

"\n"
"We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal "
"about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs "
"twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of heavy "
"fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.\n"
"\n"
"The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very "
"interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost "
"identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. Even more "
"interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the standard skin "
"of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading UFOs. This new "
"armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and various other "
"substances designed to slow and stop projectiles from penetrating. The basic "
"principle is simple enough but the new compounds have interesting properties "
"which we're not sure we fully understand. I'll see if my team can make "
"anything of it and, if so, I'll have a new research proposal ready for you "
"soon.\n"
"\n"
"The fuselage design of the Gunboat is still ostensibly that of a spacecraft, "
"but it has certain adaptations that make it much easier to handle in "
"atmosphere. It has actual wing surface generating lift, unlike the small "
"claw-winged designs which relied on brute engine power to stay airborne. "
"Furthermore, mobile flaps on the wings and stabilisers -- much like on human "
"aircraft -- allow the Gunboat to use the airflow over its surfaces, giving "
"it a much tighter turning circle, a far higher angle of attack and a "
"tremendous rate of climb compared to a UFO moving on engine power alone.\n"
"\n"
"Overall the Gunboat is fast, maneuverable and utterly deadly. It seems to "
"outperform previously-observed UFOs on every level; faster, tougher, better-"
"armed and more nimble. The only positive is that it would take three or four "
"times as much material to build a Gunboat compared to a small attack craft "
"and twice as much fuel to keep it flying, so it's unlikely we'll see "
"Gunboats in large numbers. My only worry is that they won't need very many "

"\n"
"Vi har kalt denne Ufoen «Kanonbåten», og navnet forteller deg mye om dens "
"tiltenkte funksjon. Dens våpen og pansring overstiger en tilsvarende Ufo to "
"ganger sin egen størrelse. Så vidt vi kan si er den designet for rollen "
"tungt jagerfly/avskjærer, og det oppfyller denne rollen storartet.\n"
"\n"
"Ufoen er bevæpnet med to partikkel stråle våpen samt - svært interessant nok "
"- to ekstra modulære fester med et design nesten identisk med våpenfester på "
"våre egne fly. Enda mer interessant er kanonbåtens rustning, en forbedring "
"fra standardoverflaten til fremmede materialer vi så på den første bølgen av "
"invaderende Ufoer. Denne nye pansringen er et sammensatt lag-kake av "
"fremmede materialer og diverse andre stoffer for å bremse og stoppe "
"prosjektiler fra å trenge inn. Det grunnleggende prinsippet er enkelt nok, "
"men de nye forbindelsene har interessante egenskaper som vi er ikke sikker "
"på at vi fullt ut forstår. Jeg skal se om teamet mitt kan gjøre noe av det, "
"og i så fall, vil jeg ha en ny prosjektbeskrivelse klar for deg snart.\n"
"\n"
"Skrogutformingen av kanonbåten er fremdeles tilsynelatende som et romfartøy, "
"men det har visse tilpasninger som gjør det mye enklere å håndtere i "
"atmosfæren. Det har faktisk en vingeoverflate som genererer løft, i "
"motsetning til de små klo-bevingede design som støttet seg på rå motorkraft "
"for å holde seg i luften. Videre mobile flaps på vingene og stabilisatorer - "
"omtrent som på menneskelig fly - tillater kanonbåten å bruke luftstrømmen "
"over sine overflater, noe som gir det en mye strammere svingradius, en langt "
"høyere angrepsvinkel og en enorm stigehastighet sammenlignet til en UFO som "
"beveger seg med motorkraft alene.\n"
"\n"
"Samlet sett er kanonbåten rask, manøvrerbar og absolutt dødelig. Den ser ut "
"til å overgå tidligere observerte Ufoer på alle nivå, raskere, tøffere, "
"bedre armert og kvikkere. Det eneste positive er at det ville ta tre eller "
"fire ganger så mye materiale å bygge en kanonbåt sammenlignet med en liten "
"angrep fartøy og dobbelt så mye drivstoff for å holde den flyvende, så det "
"er usannsynlig at vi vil se kanonbåter i stort antall. Min eneste bekymring "

"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
"specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
"harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
"and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew "
"has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the "
"UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is "
"they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the "
"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and "
"more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion "
"does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely "
"strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
"possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "
"full.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the "
"craft's cockpit, each equipped with the particle beam weapon we've observed "
"in other UFOs.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Its firepower is more than a match for anything we can "
"currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared "
"to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we "
"have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This "
"is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, but in most "
"cases it won't be sufficient unless we upgrade our aerial capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on a Harvester to "
"take it out as fast as possible.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some "
"frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as "
"they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can "
"build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without "
"upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous "

"landing på en planetarisk overflate og distribusjon av et utenomjordisk "
"innhøsting avdeling. Den er utstyrt med et sett av store, solide landingsben "
"og et spesielt sett med rakettmotorer plassert i Ufoens mage for å gi den "
"VTOL-evner (Vertikal Take-Off og Landing). Så snart det er landet og "
"forhøstermannskapet har samlet nok fanger, lik og annen biomasse forsvinner "
"de tilbake til Ufoen, går i bane og  forsvinner raskt tilbake der de kom "
"fra.\n"
"\n"
"Forhøsteren ser ut til å bære ut våre teorier om drivstoff kapasitet er den "
"viktigste begrensende faktor for Ufo hastighet, så det er både større og "
"raskere enn noe annet vi tidligere har observert. Det er i stand til å "
"bringe mer antimaterie-drivstoff og beskytte det langt mer effektivt med et "
"tøffere skrog, tykkere armering og mer effektiv nød-antimaterie-dumping-"
"tiltak. Selv om en eksplosjon oppstår vil det meste bli omsluttet av Ufoens "
"ekstremt sterk konstruksjon.\n"
"\n"
"Forhøsterens drivstofftank kan ta opptil 0,6 gram antimaterie og besitter en "
"potensiell eksplosiv styrke på ca 25 kilotonn når den er full.\n"

"cockpiten, hver utstyrt med partikkelstrålevåpenen vi har observert i andre "
"Ufoer.\n"
"\n"
"I luften, er det forhøster ekstremt farlig og bør være et høyt prioritert "
"mål. Dens ildkraft er mer enn en utfordring for hva som helst av det vi kan "
"stille opp med. Dens eneste åpenbare ulempe er lav manøvrerbarhet i forhold "

"større kamperfaring i Jordens atmosfære enn de utenomjordiske har. Dette er "
"en av de få fordelene vi har over forhøstere, men i de fleste tilfeller vil "
"det ikke være tilstrekkelig med mindre vi oppgradere våre luftevner.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar "
"first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar "
"were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of "
"Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, "
"throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth "
"technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence "
"later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't "
"shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls "
"under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve "
"to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, "
"decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) "
"on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is "
"clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the "
"most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is "
"the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, "
"tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit "
"will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and "
"other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as "
"their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as "
"easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides "
"a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a "
"complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its "
"price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry "
"either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft "
"Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the "
"\"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The "
"expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will "
"certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"Besides the intelligent computer at its heart, the suite has projectors of "

"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide.\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and decrease "
"its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range "
"interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far "
"distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"

"\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here "

"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
"core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
"specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
"course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
"astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of "
"this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
"astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
"system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
"intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', "
"'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters "
"can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you "
"want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when "
"plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do "
"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "
"found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs "
"with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for "
"navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "
"far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of "
"the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon "
"of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as "
"the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system "
"plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information "
"will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of "
"knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into "
"the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but "
"I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared "
"to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with "
"these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we "

"could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will "

"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike "
"any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to "
"generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction "
"chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the "
"engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to "
"fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-"
"advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the "
"engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. "
"Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are "
"constructed, how to control them, and how we might be able to use them in "
"new aircraft designs. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely "
"expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the "
"sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this "
"really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"

"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these "
"matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start "
"using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious "
"re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a "
"tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the "
"force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. "
"The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human "
"body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have "
"trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to "
"be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and "
"other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may "
"result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust "
"limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during "
"turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and "
"mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done "
"some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for "
"antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining "

"The project on alien detection is complete, Commander. We now have a full "

"\n"
"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes "
"use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses "
"or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, "
"but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics "
"as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old "
"reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the "
"Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in "
"the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now "
"identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in "
"a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity "
"field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and "
"composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial "
"objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there "
"is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to "
"be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we "
"surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range "
"of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which "
"automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be "
"adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps "
"alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or "
"increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire "
"control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence "
"control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based "
"installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and "
"increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs "
"to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is designed for close-range dogfighting. For this reason, we "
"recommend it should be part of a larger armaments pack that includes longer-"
"range weapons where possible. When closing on an enemy it is extremely "
"deadly, but if it is the only weapon available to a pilot he will be "
"vulnerable during the long approach.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "
"eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket "
"actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can "
"fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "
"greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared "
"to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely "
"to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against light UFOs. Because it "
"only requires a medium-weight hardpoint, it should be installed on lighter "
"aircraft. In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, "
"tearing mercilessly into a target. However, its limited range and accuracy "
"lead me to recommend that the Sparrowhawk Missile Rack be preferred in any "
"weapon hardpoint capable of mounting heavy weapons.\n"

"The TR-20 rocket is essentially a very small, very fast plastic dart moulded "
"around a rod of depleted uranium. It is fin-stabilised and powered by a "
"cheap solid-fuel rocket engine, a civilian model which is also popular in "
"amateur rocketry. One of these engines is capable of propelling an amateur "

"\n"
"Due to its weight, the TR-20 rocket has a maximum effective range of 4 "
"kilometres, after which the fuel runs out and the rocket rapidly loses "

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical "
"system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"Commander, we made an extremely interesting find on the UFO we disassembled. "
"It carried an advanced and highly dangerous onboard missile launcher, using "
"powerful magnetic rails to accelerate its missiles to hypersonic speeds "
"before they even leave the launch tube.\n"
"\n"
"We want to investigate this launcher and determine whether or not it can be "
"adapted to fit on PHALANX aircraft, or even if it can be applied to other "
"purposes. This launcher system would be far more effective in bringing down "
"UFOs than our Sparrowhawks, possibly even more effective than our current "
"SAM systems. If we can adapt it we stand to gain a substantial boost to the "

"Commander, we've finished work on the alien missile launcher. It's a fairly "

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearance is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "

"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans, possessing "
"digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this "
"species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely "
"blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to "
"process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to "
"make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They seem to wear no armour to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"They sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these "
"tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"We first assumed the object was a robot, but upon investigation we found a "

"more complex than basic motor skills, but troops report seeing it coordinate "
"closely with other aliens on the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself is a small, but heavy, mobile disk, able to hover above "

"battlefield rapidly. Our soldiers will need to take it down before it gets "
"in range, which is no small feat considering its size and movement "
"capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"The models we discovered are equipped with a mounted plasma weapon which is "
"able to fire single rounds. Anyone caught within range will be very sorry. "

"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "

"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and comfortable aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to "
"crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy "
"compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size "
"any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for troops that "
"need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting "

"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, "

"Commander, we've successfully prototyped our new powered armour. The "
"prototype is waiting in R&D if you'd like to have a go in it yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Our production design is geared towards maximum protection. It is, in a "
"nutshell, an airtight suit of armour with servo-assisted joints and an on-"
"board control system. The outer skin is a flexible three-layer composite, "
"with outer layers consisting of nanotube-fullerene fabric, and an inner "
"layer of special polymer gel, mixed with Wolfram-Molybdene powder. When the "
"outer layer of the composite is burned, the gel evaporates instantly, "
"dissipating the heat, and the metal powder will create a cloud around the "
"damaged area, thus creating a local bloom effect that will consume much of "
"the energy.\n"
"\n"
"The inside consists of a thick layer of memory gel covered by an "
"electrically sensitive lining. The gel allows the suit to be fitted to a "
"range of heights and body shapes, so hopefully we shouldn't have to custom-"
"build every suit to fit one specific soldier. The inner lining is an "
"important part of the control system; it detects nerve impulses through the "
"wearer's skin, interprets these signals, and uses them to predict the "
"wearer's movements before they're made. This allows the suit to move "
"simultaneously with the body rather than resisting the user's movements.\n"
"\n"
"A useful side effect of the memory gel is that it can absorb explosive "
"force, providing better shelter to explosive effects than any of our "
"previous models. Because the suit is entirely sealed, it provides much "
"better protection against environmental hazards such as gas and is effective "
"at dissipating heat, although a wearer can still be roasted inside the suit "
"if he sits in flames long enough. The helmet has built-in sensors to detect "
"flashbangs and cushion the wearer against momentary spikes of light and "
"noise intended to disorient the enemy.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma. This makes sense. It is their weapon of choice and "
"we would expect them to know how to protect against it. Because plasma "
"weaponry appears to have limited penetration capabilities, the armour is "
"able to disperse the heat before it can melt through the protective layers.\n"
"\n"
"The armour also performs pretty well against ordinary bullets and "
"explosives, although it's not very effective against incendiary devices or "
"flamethrowers. These weapons raise the atmospheric temperature around the "
"wearer so that there is no place to dump the heat, effectively roasting the "
"wearer inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll permit me, I'd like to raise a final issue with you, Commander. "
"One of my researchers has toyed with a personal laser project over the last "
"couple of months. While we were testing the alien armour, we allowed him to "
"experiment with it in his downtime and we were astonished by the results. "
"The relatively weak laser beam was hardly reduced as it passed through the "
"armor.\n"
"\n"
"I know that we've long believed that effective man-portable laser weaponry "
"is just a myth, but these suprise findings have reinvigorated my team. I'm "
"hearing all sorts of interesting proposals. This armour will seriously dent "
"our ability to use the aliens' plasma weaponry against them on the "
"battlefield. If we could use lasers to pack a reasonable punch into a hand-"
"held rifle, it could be the best response to their armor.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
"mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
"race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy "
"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "
"mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the "
"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing "
"open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will "
"still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"

"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "

"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full "
"extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to "
"examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the "
"discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn "
"their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
"communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
"and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
"given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
"there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking "
"EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is "
"another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war "
"with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
"that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
"PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
"extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
"perform up to its design spec."

"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates "
"all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets "
"data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission "
"planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that "

"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"
"absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "
"any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain "
"access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and "
"should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-"
"duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting "
"the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "
"tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains "
"nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to "
"destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick "
"and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over "
"the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
"countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
"start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
"attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
"aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air "
"Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
"batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. "
"Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-"
"mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in "
"acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a "
"hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
"miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
"study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened "
"is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other "
"incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its "
"target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply "
"need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some "
"old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our "
"results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
"engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This "
"is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an "
"airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless "
"of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on "
"the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but "
"in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics "
"suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the "
"numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has "
"agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no "
"cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage "
"any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack "
"the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting "
"our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of "
"the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to "
"completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage "
"them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or "
"later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
"designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
"longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a "
"follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
"while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
"enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
"effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "

"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"

"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "

"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "

"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "

"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "

"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-"
"injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced "
"facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has "
"available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai "
"hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific "
"bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better "
"prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the "
"coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and "
"contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to "
"completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of "
"Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected "
"to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We "
"are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and "
"regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself "
"through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical "
"nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. "
"Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full "
"health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury "
"counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. "
"Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military "
"sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes "
"and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at "
"the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford "
"the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous "
"electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for "
"treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to "
"be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in "
"a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be "
"obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; "
"convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery "
"must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic "
"upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a "
"negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to "
"kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is "
"relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their "
"primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the "
"Hospital immediately.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "
"personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and "
"several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "

"\n"
"Filed: 18 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the "
"extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as "
"effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range "
"is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further "
"installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "
"explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO "
"detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully "
"reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if "
"we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and "
"other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft "
"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "
"authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "
"labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "
"time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and "
"protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in "
"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "
"may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "
"protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility "
"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "
"of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort "
"getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets "
"nearby.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX Workshop is a small-scale production line equipped with the most "
"high-tech military manufacturing processes available. It is designed for the "
"production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on "
"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "
"assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the "
"world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines "
"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an "
"operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. "
"The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction "
"efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "
"Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present "
"technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be "
"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "
"base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission "
"objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a "
"victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to "
"destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new "
"aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute "
"necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an "
"extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive "
"posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our "
"faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these "
"nightmare scenarios.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but "
"that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the "
"entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter "
"Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN "
"nuclear site register. At full capacity just one storage facility will be "
"containing the equivalent of nearly half a megaton of TNT. While this isn't "
"much compared to modern thermonuclear weapons, it's enough to turn the "
"entire base and everything inside to cinders in less than a second. It's "
"difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but under the wrong circumstances, it can "
"happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the "
"annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the "
"containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at "
"this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed "
"particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be "
"poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"I believe I've already stressed that this facility must be the most heavily-"
"defended building in any PHALANX base, taking priority even over the Command "
"Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would "
"be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap "
"at the Antimatter Storage.\n"
"\n"
"Although this facility will be essential to our continued success in this "
"war, it's going to be very expensive to build and operate due to the "
"advanced tech and materials required. It may be necessary to hold off on "
"building one until we're sure our budget can stretch that far.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, until we manage to build one of these facilities, we'll be "
"completely unable to store or use any recovered antimatter. We can't just "
"build up a pile of unstable, alien, possibly-damaged tanks of nuclear-level "
"explosive. Everything we find will have to be destroyed for safety.\n"

"be explained through the brutal history of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of "

"Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite "

"Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a "
"panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus "
"forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and "
"warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over "
"the years as a result.\n"
"\n"
"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-"
"East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. "
"The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several "
"years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim "
"promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military "
"invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily "
"ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did "
"nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China "
"annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to "
"disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day "
"invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the "
"Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could "
"even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from "
"the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades "
"to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold "
"War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese "
"territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to "
"nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under "
"a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the "
"country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become "
"increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of "
"world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps "
"became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the "
"army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country "
"to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not "
"approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often "
"referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It "
"saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, "
"and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul "
"and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six "
"50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the "
"civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it "
"was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More "
"than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on "
"15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale "
"scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian "
"Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"The Asian Republic:\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its "
"old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, "
"including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between "
"independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and "
"respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side "
"throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new "
"Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist "
"government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new "
"council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off "
"to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel "
"nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for "
"greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be "
"disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary "
"historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese "
"researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the "
"world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly "
"joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour "
"its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging "
"economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The "
"Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still "
"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but "
"it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops "
"are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-"
"old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due "
"to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most "
"of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with "
"one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat "
"poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "
"state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world "
"superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister "
"Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While "
"the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about "
"who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own "
"problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, "
"which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. "
"Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya "
"could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it "
"did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the "
"Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in "
"Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter "
"conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power "
"plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, "
"safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from "
"enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian "
"plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new "
"type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of "
"the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and "
"from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear "
"revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted "
"element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's "
"waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The "
"Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission "
"became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the "
"world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the "
"example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power "
"generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The "
"nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and "
"commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the "
"country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether "
"under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat "
"antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it "
"does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Oceania:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the "
"countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into "
"the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when "
"joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and "
"burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own "
"parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, "
"they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in "
"military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had "
"trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the "
"Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian "
"military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the "
"country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several "
"South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the "
"Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the "
"surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated "
"the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the "
"country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines "
"were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless "
"parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small "
"regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the "
"vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the "
"Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one "
"great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the "
"Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships "
"passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was "
"free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. "
"Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth "
"seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their "
"full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of "
"Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-"
"Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and "
"Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still "
"can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its "
"own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is "
"minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves "
"only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, "
"it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"territorier, inkludert de som ble beslaglagt i tidligere århundrer og tilbyr "
"dem et valg mellom uavhengighet eller et sete i det nye statlige rådet som "
"en likeverdig og respektert del av den nye republikken. Etter å ha kjempet "
"på opprørsbevegelsens side hele borgerkrigen var Taiwan de første til å "

"etter at den kommunistiske regjeringen overga seg. Taiwan ble raskt en stor "
"aktør i det nye ministerrådet og var medvirkende i å sende de fangede "
"statsledere til Haag for å møte en krigsforbryterdomstol. Nord-Korea, en "

"Til tross for gammelt hat og mistillit sluttet andre øst-asiatiske nasjoner "

"synkende økonomi og en befolkning som hadde skrumpet inn gjennom krigsårene. "
"Republikken fortsatte mest tro mot sine prinsipper med borgerkrigen "
"fremdeles friskt i minne. Gjennom årene fikk den et rykte for å håndtere "

"De Revolusjonære land \n"
"\n"
"Med påfølgende fall både i USA og Kina, sosialismen i Sør-Amerika vokset og "
"svekket løpet av etterkrigsårene. USAs økonomiske død brakte videre en bølge "
"av revolusjonær glød beveget flere nasjoner bort fra kapitalismens "
"innflytelse. Men med et demokratisk rammeverk allerede halvveis på plass i "
"de fleste land kunne det ideelle folkestyret for første gang bli realisert "
"uten korrupsjon. Denne nye bølgen foreslo å forene prinsippene om demokrati "
"med ekte sosialistiske idealer. \n"
"\n"
"Hele kontinentet så i redsel på atombombingen av Shanghai under den andre "
"kalde krigen filmet på TV over hele verden helt opp til det siste sekund. "
"Den nye bølgen led et annet stort slag når Kina falt. I det kunne alle se et "
"førstehåndseksempel på hva som kan skje med revolusjonen om det gikk veien "
"til diktatur og totalitarisme. Det tok ikke lang tid før lederne reagerte. \n"
"\n"
"Flere diktatorledede land prøvde umiddelbart å skru til tommelskruene og "
"forsøkte å avverge et opprør før det begynte, noe som forårsaket et stor "
"tilbakeslag i de større demokratiske nasjoner, særlig Cuba, Brasil og "
"Argentina. Plutselig ble de siste gjenværende kongene i Sør-Amerika sittende "
"igjen uten venner i det hele tatt. \n"

"En etter en falt de for offentlig og politisk press og ble erstattet av "
"folkevalgte hus. Revolusjonen skjøt fart i stedet for å miste det, de "
"oppmuntret til større handel, tettere integrasjon og til slutt fulgte de "
"Europas eksempel med åpne grenser. Et nytt motorveinettverk over hele "
"kontinentet styrket økonomiene og tillot langt mer effektiv bruk av dyrket "

"United America (UA)\n"
"\n"
"Da den amerikanske økonomien begynte å bryte sammen i slutten av 2020-åra, "
"forlot flere og flere mennesker landet for grønnere beitemarker i Canada og, "
"ironisk nok, Mexico. Verdien av dollaren falt til uante dybder og utarmet "
"millioner frem til prisen ble fastsatt av IMF og det internasjonale "
"bankfellesskapet. Landet ble deretter belemret med en brutal reformplan som "
"krever at de solgte eller reserverte over halvparten av sitt militære "
"arsenal. For å takle nedbetalingen på seksten billioner dollar i gjeld ble "
"renten frosset og eksporten skiftet til teknologi og luksusvarer. Vellykket "
"restrukturering av NASA, kombinert med en funksjonell romferge-prototype, "
"snudde også verdensrommet til en pengeprodusent for det post-sammenbrutte "
"USA. Cape Canaveral begynte å tilby de billigste utskytinger på kloden, "

"Samarbeidet mellom nord-amerikanske nasjoner begynte med økonomisk støtte "

"hjelpe sin viktigste handelspartner. Det økende antall utlendinger tjente "
"også til å skape tettere bånd. Så, i den mest uventede politiske "
"snuoperasjonen i 2042, valgte Mexico USAs landsforvise Esteban Villa-Lobos "
"Garcia til President. \n"

"Valget ble svært omstridt. Likevel sto avgjørelsen gjennom to "
"valgopptellinger og den nye presidenten ble innviet i juli 2042. Til slutt "
"medførte en kombinasjon av gode retningslinjer og personlige karisma at det "
"meste av landet ble snudd mot Garcia, og da foreslo han «The Tomorrow "
"Plan». \n"
"\n"
"I henhold til planen ville Mexico, Canada og USA forenes i ett land for å "
"gjenoppvekke den nordamerikanske supermakt. I en rekke kontroversielle "
"offentlige avstemninger ga den generelle befolkningen i alle tre landene "
"flertall for The Tomorrow Plan; 52% i USA, 64% i Canada, og 71% i Mexico. "
"Fusjonen ble til slutt ferdigstilt i 2050, noe som skaper et United America "
"ut av de dominerende kreftene i den Nye Verden. Den blomstrende "
"romfartsindustrien spredte seg raskt over det nye landet, og til tross for "
"noen fall underveis gikk Nord-Amerika for full maskin mot gjenopprettelse. \n"
"\n"
"I dag har UAs gjeld redusert fra 16 til 2 billioner, og levestandarden har "
"nesten kommet til det den var før ulykken. UA har den mest avanserte "
"romfartsindustrien på planeten; NASA utfører nesten 70% av kommersielle "
"utskyter over hele verden. De eksporterer enorme mengder varer til enhver "
"annen nasjon, og ventes å returnere til soliditet om mindre enn tre år. "
"Militært, er det UA den svakeste av alle meganasjoner. Det har bare en liten "
"frivillig hær og et liten forsvarsbudsjett som mandat av IMF. Men det "
"forsvar UA har er høyt utdannet og kan snu på en krone, i stand til å nå "
"ethvert sted i landet innen to timer. \n"

"Den Større Europeiske Union \n"
"\n"
"Sakte men sikkert har EU utvidet grensene lenger og lenger for hvert tiår. "
"Den bevegde seg først inn i Midt-Østen når det aksepterte Israel som "
"assosiert medlem i 2011, og deretter oppgraderte både Israel og Tyrkia til "
"fullt medlemskap i 2017. Flere atlantiske øyer ble også akseptert i samme "
"beslutning, noe som gjør det til den største EU-utvidelsen i det 21. "
"århundre. \n"
"\n"
"Etter Israels omstridte inngang som assosiert medlem vedtok EU strengere "
"lover om menneskerettigheter, religionsfrihet og skille mellom kirke og "
"stat. Det var også den første vestlige supermakt til å offisielt anerkjenne "
"Midtøstenalliansen, og fostret nære forbindelser med alliansen - til tross "
"for USAs protester - i håp om å redusere kulturkollisjonen og den pågående "
"terrortrusselen. For det meste var det vellykket. \n"
"\n"
"I 2028 erklærte Grønland - som har vokst kraftig på grunn av innvandring fra "
"USA - formelt sin uavhengighet fra Danmark. Ingen slag ble utkjempet, og den "
"danske regjeringen anerkjente motvillig uavhengigheten på grunn av politisk "
"press fra andre europeiske land. I de påfølgende månedene, vurderte Grønland "
"en kort stund å bli med i USA som et protektorat, men revurderte når EU "
"tilbød fullt medlemskap. Dette, sammen med avhopp av flere amerikanske "
"øyprotektorater i Atlanterhavet, tilskyndet EU å endre navn til 'Den Større "
"Europeiske Union' (GEU). \n"
"\n"
"I kjølvannet av den andre kalde krigen har GEU alltid vært i forkant av "
"politisk utvikling. Det var den eneste vestlige nasjon til hjelpe Midt-"
"Østalliansens mistillitsvotum ved den gamle FN, etter at FNs fullstendig "
"mislyktes i å handle under den kinesiske ekspansjonen og endelige "
"borgerkrig. GEU har også sterkt støttet alliansens arbeid for å skape et "
"nytt FN som gir rettferdig representasjon til alle verdens nasjoner, og med "
"nok tenner til å leve opp til prinsippene under hvilke den først ble "
"opprettet. \n"
"\n"
"I dag er GEU den sterkeste økonomiske og politiske makt i verden. Men dens "
"enorme byråkrati og stort antall medlemmer - medlemmer som ikke alltid ser "
"øye til øye - gjør det treg å manøvrere på alle måter. Dens forsvar er stort "
"og kraftig, men dårlig integrert, med hver enkelt hær som holder seg til "
"sitt språk og tradisjoner. Militært samarbeid er vanskelig å oppnå og krever "
"at man går gjennom store mengder rød tape. GEU bidrar med et flertall av FN-"
"tropper, men de blir bare stadig brukt som fredsbevarende styrker. Hvorvidt "
"GEUs militære styrker har mistet grepet har vært gjenstand for het debatt i "
"Brussel i mange år, og det synes ikke å være noen avgjørelse i sikte. \n"

"Midt-Østalliansen \n"
"\n"
"Fremveksten av Midt-Østalliansen var en overraskelse for alle, inkludert de "
"involverte. Den ble designet utelukkende for å svekke vestlig innflytelse i "
"Midtøsten. De viktigste designere og første medlemmene - Iran, Syria, Jordan "
"og Afghanistan - mente aldri at alliansen skulle vare mer enn et tiår, og da "
"forventet de at det skulle fragmenteres og oppløses under vekten av dets "
"egne forskjeller. \n"
"\n"
"Den andre kalde krigen forandret alt. Folkerepublikken Kina var ikke lenger "
"en nærliggende alliert mot Vesten, det ble en ekspanderende trussel med en "
"appetitt som kastet sultne øyne på Nepal, biter av India, og muligens også "
"de suverene stater ved Kinas vestlige grense. Pakistan, Tadsjikistan og "
"Kirgisistan sprang i armene på alliansen for å gardere seg mot invasjon. Det "
"arabiske subkontinentet sluttet seg til alliansen innen et år senere, som "
"søkte å utvide sin politiske trekkraft med Vesten. Uten å tenke over det "
"hadde de dannet en kraftblokk som dekker nesten hele Midt-Østen. Deres "
"posisjon var rett og slett for god til å tillate det å forvitre. \n"
"\n"
"Den utvidede Alliansen, nå anerkjent av EU, gikk inn på den internasjonale "
"scenen med kniven i hånden. De hadde et kvelertak på de fleste av verdens "
"gjenværende oljeforsyninger og vilje til å utnytte det. \n"
"\n"
"Alliansens økonomiske makt økte etterhvert som eksterne oljereserver "
"skrumpet inn. Farmasøytiske produsenter pakket sammen i hopetall og flyttet "
"til Midt-Østen, det eneste stedet igjen i verden der oljen var billig og "
"rikelig. Dette, sammen med de mange andre råoljeanvendelser, tillot Midt-"
"Østen å overleve den russiske 'kjernefysiske revolusjon' og den påfølgende "
"verdensomspennende migreringen til kjernekraft. Den fortsatte sin ekspansjon "
"med Egypt, Usbekistan, Turkmenistan, og omstridte deler av Afrika rundt "
"Rødehavet. Hele Rødehavsregionen ble raskt beroliget da alliansen flyttet "
"inn forsvaret sitt for å hjelpe de nye afrikanske medlemmene. \n"
"\n"
"I dag har spredningen av velstand vendt Midtøsten bort fra dogmer og mot "
"sekulære lover og likestilling. Det er fortsatt styrt av enkeltpersoner - "
"sultaner, emirer, konger, presidenter og generaler - men deres personlige "
"makt holdes i sjakk av resten av alliansen, ledere som ikke ønsker at sine "
"kolleger trår over streken. Politisk opposisjon tolereres som følge av press "
"fra EU og andre nasjoner, men selv i 2084 har få av alliansens medlemsland "
"en fungerende demokratisk prosess. \n"
"\n"
"Alliansen forsvar er stor, rask og gjennomsnitt. Det er en av de mest elite "
"og velutstyrte styrker i verden, og den bruker mer ettergivende "
"engasjementregler enn de forente stater eller det asiatiske republikken. "
"Deres klausul for 'akseptable sivile tap' har vært kilde til enorme mengder "
"kritikk fra hele verden, men Alliansen har hardnakket holdt seg til denne "
"klausulen gjennom de fire tiår den har vært i kraft. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
" New Africa \n"
"\n"
"Født ut av vold og ufred fant New Africa sin forening i separasjon. Det "
"vansmektet videre i tre tiår inn i det 21. århundre, som det hadde gjort alt "
"for lenge, med sine borgerkriger, etniske utrenskninger og grusomheter "
"hinsides enhver forstand. Det vil si, inntil flere sentralafrikanske "
"nasjoner foretok et massiv prosjekt i 2039 for å bryte de beryktede "
"diamantkartellene og beslaglegge deres inntekter for langsiktig nasjonal "
"forbedring. \n"
"\n"
"Det resulterte i et militært og økonomisk blodbad. FN forsøkte ulike tiltak "
"for å stoppe kampene, men enda mer tannløs enn noen gang før, oppnådde det "
"ingenting. Imidlertid fikk Folkeforbundet etter hvert følge av flere andre "
"som var lei av å bli dyttet rundt av vestlige konglomerater, og etter flere "
"år med bitter kamp lyktes de i å ta ned kartellene én etter én. Dette "
"etterlot dem noen av de største, mest avanserte diamant- og gullgruver i "
"verden. Deres samlede territorium ble den største enkeltleverandør av "
"naturlige diamanter i verden. Det ga de også en ny følelse av hva de kunne "
"utrette sammen. Kjernen i New Africa ble født. \n"
"\n"
"Alle de afrikanske landene som var involvert i antikartellkrigen, med unntak "
"av territorier lojale til Samveldet av Oseania og Midt-Østalliansen, begynte "
"å jobbe mye tettere sammen, tok signaler fra Sør-Amerika for å bygge et "
"pålitelig veinett for å drive frem handel og kommunikasjon. Det tillot også "
"en mye bedre fordeling av mat. Over de neste 30 årene eliminerte New Africa "
"fullstendig hungersnød innenfor sine grenser, som de forandret fullstendig "
"for å imøtekomme etnisitet og et ønske om uavhengighet innen sine "
"territorier, og brakte sosialisert offentlig helsevesen til sine folk til "
"nær-ødeleggende kostnader. Men det fant også en ny eksport i "
"kommersialisert, bærekraftig vekst av tropisk hardtre og eksotisk frukt. Det "
"nye samarbeidet gjorde prisavtaler over hele kontinentet mulig for første "
"gang; slik som de revolusjonære land, tvang New Africa resten av verden til "
"å betale rettferdig for alle varer og tjenester. \n"
"\n"
"I dag er Ny-Afrika fortsatt den økonomisk svakeste av de store maktene, men "
"de vokser fort. De har en stor motivert stående hær, men troppene er ikke "
"godt utstyrt, væpnet hovedsakelig med tidligere amerikanske antikviteter og "
"hundre år gammelt sovjetisk utstyr. De har også problemer med å komme til "
"avsidesliggende steder på grunn av hyppig utstyrsfeil og kontinentets "
"vanskelig geografi. Mesteparten av tiden er det beste de nye afrikanerne kan "
"gjøre å oppdage Ufoer da de har tusenvis av speidere og små patruljer ute i "
"landet for å bekjempe krypskyting og smugling. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
" Russland \n"
"\n"
"Russland tok flere tiår på å komme seg fra Sovjetunionens fall og herjinger "
"etter det sovjetiske systemet på landets økonomi. Det gnagde som et åpent "
"sår i første halvdel av det 21. århundre og prøvde fremdeles å knuse de "
"stadige opprør i Tsjetsjenia, prøvde fremdeles å reformere etter 70 år med "
"statlig dominans, prøvde fremdeles å få tilbake sin tapte posisjon som "
"verdensledende supermakt. \n"
"\n"
"Ting begynte omsider å bli bedre for Russland når daværende statsminister "
"Jevgenij Karamazov innvilget full uavhengighet til Tsjetsjenia i 2047. Mens "
"den nylig offisielle Tsjetsjenske republikken imploderte i en storm av vold "
"om hvem som burde herske, vendte Russland seg bort og satte seg til å fikse "
"sine egne problemer og overlot Tsjetsjenia til seg selv - og det nye og "
"forbedrede FN, som umiddelbart ble interessert i å forsøke å stanse "
"blodbadet. Dessverre skulle ikke det skje på lenge, og selv da kunne "
"Tsjetsjenia bare gå tilbake til Russlands innflytelsessfære, men for første "
"gang gjorde det det som en fullt anerkjent uavhengig stemme. \n"
"\n"
"Den økonomiske redningen for Russland - særlig med oljeforsyningen fra Midt-"
"Østen synkende - begynte med boring av landets egen olje i Sibir, med nye "
"teknikker og utstyr i stand til å overleve de tøffe vinterforhold, og senere "
"med bygging av en serie nye atomkraftverk. Russland investerte tungt i "
"forskning for å gjøre de nye kraftverkene mindre, tryggere og - enda "
"viktigere - bærekraftige. Dette innebar en overgang fra anriket uran til "
"thorium som det viktigste kjernefysiske brensel for alle de nye russiske "
"kraftverkene og avansert nytt design basert på en nye 'energiforsterkeren', "
"en ny type fisjonsreaktor først testbygget i nærheten av Roma fra 2004 til "
"2011. To av de nye reaktorene forbruker også plutonium fra demonterte "
"atomvåpen og fra lagrede avfall fra eldre kraftverk. \n"
"\n"
"Deretter, åtte år etter den Tsjetsjenske uavhengighet kom Russlands "
"'kjernefysiske revolusjon' virkelig til sin rett med oppfinnelsen av utarmet "
"postprosessorelement, noe som kan konvertere 90% av en energiforsterkers "
"avfall til strålingsfrie elementer i løpet av uker i stedet for århundrer. "
"Russerne endte den eldgamle energikrisen nesten over natten; kjernefysisk "
"fisjon ble trygg, forholdsvis ren, og globale thoriumforsyninger ville se "
"verden klart i år 3000. \n"
"\n"
"I dag har mange av de tidligere sovjetrepublikkene sluttet seg til Russland, "
"etter eksempel av de andre store nasjoner, ivrige etter å dra nytte av "
"kraftproduksjon og kjernefysisk teknologi som nå er Russlands viktigste "
"eksportartikler. Den kjernefysiske revolusjonen fortsetter også i dag med en "
"gradvis utvikling og kommersialisering av fusjonskraft. Selv om økonomien "
"fortsatt er urolig, er landet nå i bedre form enn det har vært i århundrer - "
"enten det var under khanene, tsarene eller Sovjet. Dens forsvar er noe "
"foreldet, men høyt utdannet, godt disiplinert og profesjonelt, og det er "
"ikke mangel på arbeidskraft. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Samveldet av Oseania \n"
"\n"
"Samveldet av Nasjoner, en politisk organisasjon bestående av de fleste av "
"landene til det gamle britiske imperiet, mistet mye av makten på vei inn i "
"den andre kalde krigen. Først kuttet Pakistan sine bånd til Samveldet da de "
"ble med i MidtøstAlliansen. Så, mens USA krasjet og brant, ble Storbritannia "
"og Canada mer og mer opptatt av sine egne deler av verden og lot sin "
"deltakelse svinne til ingenting. I 2030 var de medlemmer bare i navnet. \n"
"\n"
"Den økende makten til Kina under hele krigen førte til en voldsom ekspansjon "
"i militære budsjetter for India og Australia, budsjetter som deres økonomier "
"hadde problemer med å støtte. Deretter, i 2035 ble India en ekstra slagmark "
"i den kinesiske borgerkrigen. Veteranregjeringsoldater beseiret lett det "
"indiske militæret i flere korte, men blodige slag og tok det meste av landet "
"mens opprørerne fortsatte. \n"
"\n"
"Australia lovet en full-skala militærintervensjon sammen med flere Sør-"
"Afrikanske Samveldemedlemmer. Etter uker med brutale kamper, klarte de "
"australske divisjonene å koble seg sammen med kinesiske opprørsstyrker og "
"overlevende regimenter fra den indiske hæren, og sammen har de nesten "
"utslettet den statlige hæren før overlevering i 2036. \n"
"\n"
"Kostnadene var høye. De erobrede delene av India var en ødemark, hadde "
"landet ingen regjering igjen etter atombombingen av New Delhi, og hungersnød "
"var allerede begynt å gripe befolkningen. Det begynte å avstå verdiløse "
"deler av landet til andre nasjoner og ga uavhengighet til flere små områder "
"langs grensen. De resterende Samveldelandene foretok den enorme oppgaven med "
"å rekonstruere India, men mange forlot prosjektet og Samveldet i favør av de "
"andre voksende supermaktene. \n"
"\n"
"Gjenoppbygging av India samlet til slutt Samveldet til en stor nasjon, dro "
"nytte av sin geografiske plassering rundt Det indiske hav og det sørlige "
"Stillehavet til å belaste strategiske tariffer på skip som passerte gjennom "
"deres farvann. Samveldeshippingen derimot var fri for toll og steg raskt til "
"dominans i det konkurranseutsatte markedet. Senere, med ødeleggelsen av "
"diamantkartellene i Afrika, grep Samveldet flere lederløse gruver innenfor "
"sine grenser og brukte dem til deres fulle potensial. \n"
"\n"
"I dag er Samveldet av nasjoner bedre kjent som 'Samveldet av Oseania' eller "
"bare 'Oseania'. Siden oppstarten har det akseptert flere ikkesamveldeland "
"inn i sin midte, særlig Madagaskar, Zimbabwe og Indonesia, og utvider sin "
"kontroll over Oseanias farvann. Selv om det fortsatt ikke kan konkurrere "
"økonomisk med de rike landene har det meislet ut sin egen nisje, og er "
"ganske fornøyd med å fortsette sin fremgang i det. \n"
"\n"
"Oseanias forsvar består i all hovedsak av en mektig marine. Dens landarmé er "
"forsvinnende liten sammenlignet med enhver nasjon utenom De forente stater, "
"og tjener bare i en defensiv kapasitet, med gjennomsnittlig trening og "
"utstyr. Men det kan svare ganske raskt i krisesituasjoner."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art "
"equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to "
"combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "
"budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some "
"new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the "
"opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but "
"after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into "
"obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its "
"commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their "
"aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk "
"couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's "
"slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the "
"country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in "
"2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was "
"dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown "
"into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered "
"reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The "
"existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter "
"of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The "
"massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them "
"secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on "
"television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of "
"their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap "
"of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things "
"got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, "
"Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it "
"began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session "
"continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with "
"lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien "
"invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. "
"It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in "
"the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, "
"however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one "
"could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the "
"Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as "
"well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned "
"missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that "
"counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital "
"defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear "
"missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish "
"projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one "
"aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, "
"designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an "
"invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it "
"to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part "
"of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, "
"known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the "
"world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a "
"hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to "
"resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was "
"tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were "
"dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the "
"secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support "
"and the men it needed to go to war.\n"

"«Falanksprosjektet» ble først utformet av USAs forsvarsdepartement i 1955, "
"etter år med økende bekymring over økt antall Ufo-observasjoner over hele "
"verden. Muligheten for en utenomjordisk invasjon hjemsøkte hodene til "
"politikere som allerede var lammet av kjernekraft i Sovjetunionen. "
"Eksistensen av fiendtlig utenomjordisk liv i universet virket veldig fjern, "
"enda mindre at disse fiendene kunne finne Jorden blant all den enorme "
"plassen - men kunne Amerika ha råd til å ta den sjansen?\n"
"\n"
"Prosjektets talsmenn brukte to år på å bygge støtte blant de høyeste "
"maktnivåer. Endelig, i 1957, fikk Falanks sin første bevilgning. En "
"betydelig del av årets 'svarte budsjett' gikk til bygging av en avansert "
"underjordisk kompleks i Nevada-ørkenen et sted på territoriet til Nellis Air "
"Force Base. Komplekset ble kalt «Falanks Stillehavskommando», lastet med "
"moderne utstyr, og bemannet med de beste og smarteste til å hamre ut hvordan "
"man best kan bekjempe et utenomjordisk fientlig angrep på amerikansk jord.\n"
"\n"
"Prosjektet var en gnistrende suksess i sine formende år, utvikling av "
"banebrytende teknologi og produksjon av fungerende prototyper av ting i "
"verden aldri hadde sett før, alt for en brøkdel av den kostnadene som sivile "
"entreprenører ville brukt. På grunn av sin natur var Falanks gjenstand for "
"årlige budsjettkamper, men dens R&D-suksesser alltid ga prosjektet en grunn "
"til å fortsette selv for de mest fundamentalistiske praktikalister.\n"
"\n"
"Men verden beveget seg mens Falanks fortsatte å forberede seg for noe som "
"aldri skjedde. Vietnam-krigen så en enorm oppsving i militærutgifter, nesten "
"ingen av disse var avsatt til Falanks eller lignende prosjekter, som så sine "
"egne budsjetter kuttet og brent i møte med krigen. Til tross for gjentatte "
"forespørsler om mer midler, avviste Joint Chiefs det besynderlige 1950-"
"programmet som 'pie-in-the-sky'-utgifter og lot det fortsette bare på grunn "
"av sin forskningsinnsats. Mesteparten av den resterende finansieringen gikk "
"til å holde gammelt utstyr vedlikeholdt og laboratorier gående, om bare så "
"vidt.\n"
"\n"
"Falanks ble aldri helt restituert etter krigen. De ville aldri igjen få "
"budsjettene de hadde på 50-tallet, storhetstiden var over. De leverte noe ny "
"teknologi som ble brukt i Golfkrigen, og opplevde kort verdiøkning løpet av "
"de første årene av det 21. århundre på grunn av skyhøye amerikanske militære "
"budsjetter, men etter disse korte kreativitetsspurter skulle prosjektet "
"igjen visne inn i glemselen.\n"
"\n"
"Den andre kalde krigen tappet bort det siste liv igjen i prosjektet. Dets "
"sjefer slet med å holde det gående uten engang penger til å beholde sin fly "
"på himmelen, men selv oppfinnelsen av kunstig edderkopp silke kunne ikke "
"redde dem fra USAs krasjende økonomi. Landets skred inn i ruin innsnevret "
"hvert 'ikkeessensielle' militære program i landet, en etter en, og Falanks "
"ble endelig strøket fra budsjettet i 2027. Det var fem måneder unna sin 70 "
"år. De ansatte ble avskjediget, basen demontert, det unike utstyret stengt "

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"New information has come to light that you need to see. We've discovered a "
"commonality that may give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered "
"some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained "
"sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the "
"problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, "
"again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for "
"storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I "
"spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found "
"the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our "
"blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be "
"found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed "
"that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. "
"The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge "
"numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for "
"each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. "
"Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of "
"chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its "
"source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no "
"variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to "
"believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in "
"part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
"infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests "
"on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. "
"The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or "
"positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are "
"essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism "
"requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a "
"parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a "
"complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it "
"acts and replicates exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is "
"warranted. As each alien species carries a unique strand of the infection, "
"we have given them alphabetical designations after the source species in "
"which the strand can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so "
"forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only "
"thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. "
"We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit "
"each species, perhaps something that allows them to coexist the way they "
"do.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious to humans. When "
"injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed "
"the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, "
"however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard "
"human T cells. The organism was unable to take root in the face of our "
"immune system.\n"
"\n"
"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers "
"on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated "
"about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our personnel is "
"in progress, just in case, and strict quarantine procedures will be "
"maintained throughout the lab.\n"

"Our study on antimatter is complete, Commander, and we're ready to present "
"our results. I'm afraid the news is mostly bad.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of things the aliens know that we don't. Nowhere is this "
"more clear in their widespread use of antimatter. It seems to be plentiful "
"for them, at least plentiful enough to send out UFO after UFO to Earth, "
"burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into antimatter, on the "
"other hand . . .\n"
"\n"
"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of "
"anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near "
"Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not long after, another "
"lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come slowly forward over the "
"years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by "
"the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
"availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with "
"every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
"antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
"gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a "
"UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over the "
"past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in "
"the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom "
"line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they "
"create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to "
"do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts "
"will be fruitless.\n"
"\n"
"Our only major successes have come from studying how the aliens store their "
"antimatter. We're confident we can employ the same magnetic storage "
"techniques, creating special facilities for safely storing antimatter. I've "
"sent you a set of blueprints in a separate message to peruse at your "
"convenience. We've also designed antimatter fuel tanks that should fit in "
"our interceptors given some major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full "
"understanding of the alien engines before we can begin designing a new "
"aircraft propulsion system.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If "
"we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering "
"it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may "
"have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we "

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures in the device are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, "
"very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all "
"of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of "
"our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "

"\n"
"In one experiment, an alien specimen was given a box of food, sealed by a "
"two-digit number lock. The subject took six hours to find the right "
"combination by trial and error. This places the alien's IQ well below most "
"large terrestrial mammals; however, when other subjects in the Containment "

"security and separation. The aliens have not been allowed to communicate in "
"any way. We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about "

"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "

"Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do "

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our "
"ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. "
"Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "
"learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign "
"language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and "
"instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign "
"language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on "
"trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been "
"easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical "
"encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The "
"casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to "
"have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or "
"even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical "
"differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This "
"indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared "
"consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it "
"merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from "
"our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share "
"one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means "
"of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an "
"indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and "
"breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even "
"specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens "
"will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various "
"species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate "
"with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign "
"language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep "
"conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own "
"body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain "
"really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
"part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
"homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission "
"to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to "
"distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to "
"tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would "
"like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more "
"effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a "
"healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to "
"maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would "
"be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"As you're aware, we are facing an increasingly worsening threat from the XVI "

"\n"
"Subjects under the influence of this drug have proven to be more pliable and "

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders "

"points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they "
"go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "
"anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The "
"region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars "

"been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There "
"has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various "
"base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"

"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar "

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. "
"It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting "
"a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to "
"answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the "
"ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal "
"-- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have "
"gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our "
"most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "
"thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then "
"channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO "
"extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing "
"it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system "
"continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to "
"keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used "
"to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If "
"a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a "
"gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the "
"Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as "
"possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to "
"jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on "
"the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of "
"the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion "
"represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is "
"that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, "
"regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation "
"detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be "
"impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, "
"every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at "
"high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is "
"quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a "
"memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a "
"more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a "
"more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher "
"than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far "
"more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components "
"and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this "
"craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the "
"individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve "
"deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to "
"counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I "
"can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us "
"in the fight for Earth.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"

"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have "
"commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated "
"performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are "
"performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police "
"or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the "
"arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and "
"study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take "
"them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby "
"giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% "
"of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or "
"another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million "
"unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to "
"within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be "
"exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have "
"been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien "
"activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress "
"we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder "
"the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment "
"and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of "
"personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped "
"directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"
"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection "
"levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in "
"conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien "
"activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes "
"critical.\n"
"\n"
"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with "
"additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by "
"the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in "
"this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"\n"
"With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian "
"population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine "
"the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. "
"Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as "
"finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all "
"registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a "
"small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a "
"week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under "
"suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single "
"drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately "
"the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these "
"samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got an extensive report for you regarding our work on deciphering the "
"patterns of alien activity and their overall strategy for Earth. You can "
"find the full document in our archives, but I will give you a quick "
"summation here.\n"
"\n"
"The most striking characteristic we've seen of the invasion is that the "
"aliens have been harvesting human biomass, sometimes even whole people, for "
"their own nebulous purposes. They do this in a rather gruesome manner that "
"shows no respect for life; they cut up human beings as if butchering cattle, "
"and their Bloodspiders will simply dissect someone on the spot for a "
"particularly interesting organ or a pint of blood. It is utterly, amorally "
"practical.\n"
"\n"
"We can only assume that they use the samples they're gathering in some kind "
"of research program, studies into our physiology and perhaps our psychology "
"and culture as well. We don't know the reasons behind this, but it's an "
"interesting point. They are trying to learn something about us, and they "
"don't care how we feel about it. To them, we're merely objects to be "
"studied.\n"
"\n"
"Of further interest are their main targets. Until recently alien activity "
"reports came almost exclusively from high-density population centres with "
"easy landing access for UFOs, which ties in with the general objective of "
"capturing human research material. However, as of late the focus of the "
"campaign seems to have shifted or narrowed. Activity around hospitals, blood "
"banks and bio-research laboratories has been noticed more and more "
"frequently in addition to the usual raids on population centres. The "
"activity has ranged from low-key infiltration for unknown purposes up to "
"full-scale assaults on high-security labs. We're not sure yet what this "
"shift could mean, but we are making recommendations to the UN to sharpen "
"security in these facilities and arm local forces to stand up to alien "
"attack. We've marked up a list of high-risk targets for rapid police "
"response and are distributing handbooks on anti-alien tactics. More "
"investigation into the change of targets is underway.\n"
"\n"
"As always, there is a lot more alien activity going on outside of our "
"detection range which goes unreported by civilian authorities. DivIntel is "
"currently experimenting with new ways of reporting and responding to alien "
"activity as well as better networking between UN nations to get valid "
"information to PHALANX faster, all of which are direct results of our "
"research into the aliens' strategy. We expect that these techniques will "
"allow us to catch an estimated 10% of alien activity (out of total estimated "
"activity on Earth) that would have previously gone unreported.\n"
"\n"
"We've also looked into how UFOs are getting to and from Earth, despite our "
"problems finding and tracking the elusive larger craft we've observed. After "
"reviewing radar, lidar and video recordings made from observatories on the "
"planet surface, we now believe the larger UFOs to be some manner of aircraft "
"carrier; a simple FTL-equipped base ship ferrying smaller UFOs to and from "
"Earth.\n"

"This craft is of extreme importance and we must find some way to shoot it "
"down from orbit if we can. We should keep a close guard, Commander.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Let me begin by stating a few ugly realities.\n"
"\n"
"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the "
"initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, "
"and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of "
"volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which "
"are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly "
"exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an "
"instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid "
"does come under attack, comms between PHALANX Command Centres and assets in "
"the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying "
"items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is "
"nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer "
"under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at "
"all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've "
"fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-"
"planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are "
"years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane "
"in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at "
"our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are "
"nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too "
"destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever "
"managed to score a hit. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into "
"extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that "
"has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're "
"going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, "
"but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are "
"starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is "
"to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency "
"to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our "
"extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base "
"colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with "
"enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library "
"of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns "
"into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. "
"We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to "
"lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built "
"into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in "
"front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on "
"the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling "
"block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in "
"order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its "
"own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the "
"UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- "
"to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, "
"heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely "
"necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"
"\n"
"As you see, Sir, these problems can all be overcome, but we need to do some "
"serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please "
"lend your authorisation as soon as is feasible.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy "
"assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and "
"light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "
"It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien "
"positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from "
"all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault "
"weapon.\n"

"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the "
"shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-"
"designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic molecules "
"before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced regularly, but we've designed the system to "
"make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during "
"the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in "
"order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production, since more refining and balancing is required for real-world "
"combat. I've submitted new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas "
"we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Our collected UN research files have yielded a lot of valuable information "
"about weapon development done on Earth since the beginning of this century. "
"One of the most interesting topics has been the production of DEWs (Directed "
"Energy Weapons), weapons that transfer energy to a target by means other "
"than a projectile. We are particularly interested in the files on Continuous "
"Wave Lasers.\n"
"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers "
"over the years, but no one has ever been able to create a laser that's man-"
"portable and has a power output high enough to compete with ordinary "
"firearms. Now, however, we've been given access to all this combined "
"research. I believe that we can make an effective laser weapon at sizes "
"previously unheard-of for a DEW.\n"
"\n"
"This will be a preliminary research report. I can't promise we'll return "
"immediately with a powerful man-portable laser weapon. The only mobile laser "
"weaponry we've been able to get close to in the past has been mounted on "
"heavy vehicles. But I am optimistic we can miniaturize it enough to mount on "
"light interceptor craft and may even be able to leverage the inherit "
"accuracy and speed of laser weaponry to deliver a powerful ground-to-air "
"threat that could help us knock these things out of the sky.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "
"in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can "
"survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP "
"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "
"trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's "
"ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-"
"sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its "
"size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever we need an automatic weapon no larger than our own P-12, this is "

"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "

"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire high-"
"explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as "
"light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience "
"has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the "
"handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and "
"there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "

"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel and are fin-stabilised in flight. Surprisingly "
"they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an "
"impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping "
"power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It is one of "
"the heaviest and most cumbersome rifles one might legitimately call a rifle, "
"but in the hands of a trained specialist it is extraordinarily accurate.\n"

"We've received a number of research files from several UN nations concerning "
"research and development for man-portable electromagnetic weaponry; various "

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade "
"materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and "
"have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd "
"figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we "
"ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape "
"into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade "
"with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be "
"used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half "
"during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until "
"we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a "
"function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands "
"during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, "
"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"

"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "

"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the "

"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
"troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of "
"the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a "
"soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses "
"or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the "
"feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to "
"make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, "
"then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, "
"one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten "
"sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The "
"backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special "
"fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, "
"creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a "
"fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts "
"horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees "
"celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it "
"leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding "
"area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly "
"safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This is a 200mm canister of high-pressure flammable gas, locked and secured "
"via three different systems to prevent accidents. Compound 90 is a new "
"flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, creates a slow "
"thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a fuel-air explosion "
"-- that can roast living tissue in seconds. Its range is limited, as the C90 "
"must be quickly ignited before it disperses, but it inflicts horrific damage "
"on organic targets that few weapons can hope to match. The heat generated by "
"C90 exceeds 1700 degrees celsius, enough to melt titanium, but due to its "
"gaseous nature it leaves no burning residue (like napalm) and disperses heat "
"much more quickly. This makes it significantly safer for urban use than "
"napalm-derivative substances.\n"
"\n"
"The canister is meant to be loaded into a CRC-FL Flamethrower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All soldiers equipped with flamethrowers should carry at least one reload "
"whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send our troops "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "
"until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of "
"effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag "
"grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are "
"placed at risk.\n"
"\n"
"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of "
"available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner "
"might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can "
"significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our "
"troops. Its utility is not to be underestimated.\n"

"\n"
"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was "
"first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or "
"metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th "
"century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made "
"them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: "
"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of "
"the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 "
"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "
"may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to "
"work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important "
"attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Though quite effective against enemy infantry, frag grenades are weapons of "
"opportunity, not a replacement for firearms or portable artillery. Their "

"\n"
"Incendiary grenades are area-denial weapons, covering a large stretch of "
"ground with very hot flames that are almost impossible to extinguish. Once "
"thrown, the body of the grenade explodes, spreading the incendiary compound "
"over the surrounding area -- and anyone unlucky enough to be inside the area "

"\n"
"The standard American M71 grenade consists of a core of C8 explosive, an "
"inner layer of incendiary agent, and an outer plastic casing that provides "
"no fragmentation but more importantly doesn't slow down or otherwise impede "
"the delivery of the payload over a large area. The M71's casing is a smooth "

"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes. When fired in Impact mode, the grenades will "
"explode as soon as they hit something -- a wall or the target. They'll also "
"explode the moment they reach their target destination, a nice way to ensure "
"the grenade will explode near to where the soldier is aiming it.\n"
"\n"
"But it also has a Timer mode. When fired this way, the grenades will "
"detonate several seconds after leaving the barrel regardless of what happens "
"in those seconds. This is great for bouncing a grenade around a corner or "
"firing a long shot, but it is harder to be precise.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "

"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, "
"and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's "
"standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the "
"last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of "
"swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "
"Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
"will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "
"aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection "
"range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up "
"on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching "
"threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
"exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. "
"However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 "
"Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "
"engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man "
"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most "
"of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing "
"them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty "
"inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this "
"penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire "

"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"
"\n"
"Given the unusual grip, we haven't drawn up specs for producing these things "
"in-house. You'll only be able to use what you can collect on the battlefield "
"for now, but we'll continue to brainstorm ideas for how to incorporate this "
"technology into our own weaponry.\n"

"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol that won't be rendered completely ineffective by alien armour.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "

"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"

"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Still, the laser will "
"burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "

"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "

"Commander, I'd like to report that we've successfully prototyped the new "
"electrolaser design and have approved final plans for a production model. We "
"can now begin to utilise it in combat. As per usual, I've written up the "
"specs and deployment advice here for you.\n"
"\n"
"From a technical standpoint, the electrolaser works on almost the same "
"principles as natural lightning. It pumps electricity through a channel of "
"ionised air -- what we refer to as a 'plasma channel' -- that is more "
"conductive than the air around it, allowing the electricity to arc all the "
"way to the target and then earth itself, causing severe shock damage. This "
"plasma channel is created by a short, high-powered laser pulse which causes "
"the air to begin ionising\n"
"\n"
"Electrolasers are a tried and true concept on Earth. They have a history of "
"use going back several decades as less-than-lethal weapons. At their most "
"basic, they are a 'taser without the wires', but until now they've suffered "
"serious limitations due to battery capacity and the power levels required to "
"knock out a soldier in insulated body armour. For this reason they've only "
"ever been developed practically as single-shot disposables and close-range "
"civilian weapons. Thanks to the output of our deuterium-fluoride lasers and "
"energy systems, though, we've been able to go a lot further than that.\n"
"\n"
"Our electrolaser can project a stable plasma channel at short to medium "
"ranges, depending on atmospheric conditions, and deliver previously unheard-"
"of voltages to the target. It is effective against organic enemies but "
"robotic enemies are likely to be designed to disperse the charge.\n"
"\n"
"Now for the cons.\n"
"\n"
"The more powerful electrical systems and laser equipment have increased size "
"and weight considerably compared to the stun rod. Another, more practical "
"issue is the power unit. We couldn't quite achieve the desired power output "
"profile using our standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges, so we've had to "
"make adjustments to the ammunition package itself. I'm afraid this means "
"that ammunition for the electrolaser is NOT interchangeable with ammunition "
"for our regular laser weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, no matter what the drawbacks might be, performance is light-years "
"ahead of Dr. Connor's stun rod. I highly recommend we start taking "

"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Medikits come with three prepared treatment capabilities. Apply First Aid "
"will treat a soldier's wounds, stemming the blood loss of a wound in an "
"effort to keep them alive. It will restore a small amount of health, but "
"soldiers will need to recover back at base.\n"
"\n"
"Stimulants can be used to revive a soldier who has fallen unconcious as a "
"result of being stunned or gassed.\n"
"\n"
"Antipsychotics will provide an injection of endorphins. Many desperate "
"commanders have found it useful to boost morale during highly stressful "
"engagements."

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"

"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate. It can't be thrown effectively because "
"its chances of achieving a seal are very low. Planting one by hand has a "
"much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while "
"wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. "
"All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before "
"it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all "
"the alien weapons, it's very nasty and very dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, "
"a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid "
"hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast "
"zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The "

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "

"We've got design documents in place for your engineers to build new ammo "
"cartridges for the Assault Rifle, Machine Gun and SR-1 Sniper Rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The Encased Plasma Ammo is essentially a shape charge miniaturized to fit "

"target, the tip fragments and the small plasma core slams into the armour. "

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared "
"a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
"rifle, but an unusual one. Like a machine gun, it is designed to saturate a "
"target with projectiles, but it takes this concept much further. It vomits "
"out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
"easily tear apart a target.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, "
"hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute "
"into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for "
"as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike "
"bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to "
"target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low "
"in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing. They are easily "
"knocked off course for the same reason, but so many needles are put down "
"range that even distant shots are likely to make some contact with the "
"enemy.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
"electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
"coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too "
"energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made "
"it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We "
"may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research. I've "
"put a new research proposal in your queue along these lines.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler's electromagnet array makes it much heavier than the average "
"rifle, which could reduce the effectiveness of some of our troops. But given "
"its deadly power, I'm sure more than a few of our boys will gladly shed some "
"other equipment to carry the Needler into battle.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "
"needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious "
"casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler "
"is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to "
"flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an entrenched needler "
"gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend anyone to try it, "

"our Coilgun.\n"
"\n"
"Combining an alien-inspired power pack and coil arrangement with some of our "
"Bolter technology has solved many of the coilgun design's inherent problems. "
"A hundred years ago, the energy efficiency of coilguns measured less than "
"2%; meaning, the energy of the projectile at the time of impact was less "
"than 2% of the energy used to fire it. Even with today's technology coilgun "
"efficiency is limited to single digits, but the alien Needler manages "
"efficiency ratings as high as 70%. It may take us years to get to that "
"level, but with the Coilgun we've developed something that is both practical "
"and effective for the war effort.\n"
"\n"
"In order to get better acceleration out of the coils, we've created a new "
"kind of ammunition, based on the aliens' needle alloy. In shape it's a "
"fairly standard fin-stabilised penetrator inside a discarding sabot, but "
"it's made from materials never before seen on Earth. Discarding sabot rounds "
"are normally used for much larger calibres -- we've effectively scaled down "
"an anti-tank round -- but the armour-piercing potential is phenomenal, "
"higher than any other weapon we have. In fact, the Coilgun is now the "
"highest-calibre infantry weapon on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"Of course we've had to make some sacrifices -- high weight due to the coils "
"and electrical equipment contained in the barrel, low ammunition capacity "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "

"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the "
"most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first "
"prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese "
"government. Production models were only trickling into government units by "
"the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to "
"respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew "
"through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version "
"of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with "
"aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally "
"through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round "
"at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of "
"SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next "
"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "
"the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly "
"50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known "
"design flaw.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification "
"CRC-8.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very "
"well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out "
"to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be "
"too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"
"\n"
"While the CRC-8 does suffer excessive muzzle climb on full auto, throwing "
"off the aim of even experienced users, it is much more docile in its "
"standard burst mode. Full auto should rarely be considered outside of panic "
"situations.\n"

"Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like "

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 8-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows repeated shots without losing "
"control.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is not as effective at very great distance, but for a PHALANX squad's "
"typical short-range skirmishing, this should not become a problem.\n"
"\n"
"The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. "
"Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than "
"any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1 should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; it is too unwieldy to fire off quick snap shots with any accuracy. "
"Marksmen should assume a crouched firing position for extra stability "
"whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user. The stun rod is "
"more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. "
"Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"

"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"\n"
"Now that we know how to keep captured aliens alive in containment, our lack "

"with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which "
"should be sufficient to disable the hardiest alien races we may encounter. "
"We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be "

"secure prisoners. The electrical shock could still be countered by "
"sophisticated armour and may not be effective on robotic alien devices.\n"

"Vi har alltid mistenkt at en ekte utenomjordisk hær ville bringe mer "

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. "
"Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious "
"about this war.\n"

"Kommandant, min metode fungerte. Jeg tror vi har klart å knekke "
"hemmelighetene til det mystiske partikkelstrålevåpenet. Her er mine "
"konklusjoner.\n"
"\n"
"Forekomsten av bærbare partikkelstrålevåpen antyder en alvorlig opptrapping "
"i denne krigen. Forut for å bli skutt på med dette hadde vi ingen anelse om "
"at romvesenene hadde slik avanserte teknologi, og vi har ingen anelse om "
"hvorfor det ikke ble utplassert før nå. Romvesenes motivasjon og strategi "
"forblir en komplett mysterium for oss. Likevel tror jeg ikke jeg overdriver "
"spørsmålet om at disse våpnene forandrer alt.\n"
"\n"
"Når jeg prøver å beskrive dette må du forstå at jeg ikke snakker om de "
"faktiske våpen. Som jeg har nevnt i rapportene mine er våpnene i seg selv i "
"utgangspunktet ikke noe mer enn et metallskall rundt et sett av magneter og "
"elektrostatiske linser, alle brukt for å fokusere og innsnevre "
"partikkelstrålen. Den virkelige magien skjer i et område omtrent på "
"størrelse med knyttneven min. Jeg snakker om det vi tidligere har tenkt på "
"som «magasinet», inntil nå. Hva det egentlig er er utrolig.\n"
"\n"
"Hvert enkelt magasin er faktisk en synkrotron partikkelakselerator av "
"ufattelige små proporsjoner, pakket rundt en batteripakke så liten at vi "
"ikke engang kan begynne å forestille oss hvordan de bygde det. Synkrotronen "
"øker hastigheten på partiklene rundt og rundt i en svært liten sirkel - "
"mindre enn diameteren av magasinet - inntil de har oppnådd tilstrekkelig "
"hastighet. Partiklene blir deretter viderekoblet via et magnetisk felt inn i "
"fokusrekker, der de er magnetisk innsnevret - «klemt» - inn i en "
"sammenhengende stråle.\n"
"\n"
"Kommandant, det er ingen sjanse i helvete at vi kan bygge akseleratorer så "
"komplekse så små. Ikke i vår levetid. Verken vi på Falanks eller resten av "
"verden har presisjondmaskiner eller den nødvendige kunnskap for å duplisere "
"utenomjordisk teknologi. Vi har dokumentert hvordan våpnene fungerer, og de "
"er enkelt nok å produsere, men hvis vi faktisk ønsker å bruke dem er vi nødt "
"til å rappe magasiner fraromvesener. Verre, disse små akseleratorer er satt "
"under enorme belastninger i sin levetid, og de vil begynne å feile etter å "
"ha blitt brukt bare noen få ganger. Vår ammunisjonsforsyninger vil være "
"knappe i beste fall, begrenset til hva vi kan gjenvinne i feltet.\n"
"\n"
"Hvis romvesener har utbredt tilgang til denne typen teknologi, og det gjør "
"de åpenbart, kunne jeg ikke fortelle deg hvorfor de ikke har bare valset inn "
"og moste menneskeheten. Deres krigsmaskin er flere størrelsesordener større "
"enn vår. Deres teknologi er mer avansert, de har mange flere og bedre fly, "
"og likevel kommer de fortsatt mot oss i rykk og napp. Det er uforståelig. "
"Imidlertid vil enhver god soldat fortelle deg at «hvorfor» spiller ingen "
"rolle akkurat nå. Der er de som gjør feil og det er opp til oss å dra nytte "
"av det.\n"
"\n"
"Vi trenger å oppgradere, oppruste, og trene alt vi har, Kommandant. Alt. Vi "
"må være klar før de begynner å ta krigen på alvor.\n"

#~ "achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
#~ "battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies "
#~ "to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. "
#~ "Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part "
#~ "of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they "
#~ "have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers "
#~ "with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an "
#~ "infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications "
#~ "were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-"
#~ "missile batteries.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
#~ "miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
#~ "deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products "
#~ "without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of "
#~ "the inner workings.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen "
#~ "trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are "
#~ "then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The "
#~ "deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of "
#~ "deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's "
#~ "optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses "
#~ "then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even "
#~ "corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium "
#~ "waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering "
#~ "system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling "
#~ "the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed "
#~ "the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is "
#~ "somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will "
#~ "immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
#~ "beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
#~ "production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
#~ "required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be "
#~ "applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted "
#~ "several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn "
#~ "up.\n"

#~ "long range to damage UFO armour after only a few seconds of fire. "
#~ "Accuracy is good; the laser suffers much less from alien EW (Electronic "
#~ "Warfare) activity than missiles and can even predict basic evasive "
#~ "manoeuvres.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Of course, as with any laser, range remains a problem. Atmospheric "

#~ "overheating comes into play, and it requires up to 60 seconds to cool "
#~ "down and recharge capacitors before it's ready to fire again.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite these limitations, the Base Defence Laser Turret should provide "

#~ "We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences "
#~ "in our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that "
#~ "may begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
#~ "intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
#~ "individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior "
#~ "communications and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an "
#~ "intense review of battlefield footage now seem to contradict that "
#~ "hypothesis.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
#~ "coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no "
#~ "obvious communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live "
#~ "specimens in our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above "
#~ "the level of animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we "
#~ "have; large, well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of "
#~ "combat tactics.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our "
#~ "experiments have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens "
#~ "certainly are responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but "
#~ "we originally assumed that they were officers of some type under colour "
#~ "of authority. We now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our "
#~ "experiments prove that when the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or "
#~ "without the suspected 'officers', they become significantly more active "
#~ "and sophisticated. When they are separated from each other for a large "
#~ "enough distance, they revert back to their basic states. The conclusion "
#~ "is obvious. There is some kind of communal force binding these creatures "
#~ "together.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in "
#~ "the alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet "
#~ "the physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show "
#~ "little to no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence "
#~ "of some kind of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind "
#~ "that grows more intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how "
#~ "it's possible for this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's "
#~ "obvious that the different alien races originated on different worlds, "
#~ "with vastly divergent evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have "
#~ "been around far longer than others. However, given the aliens' advanced "
#~ "technology, the 'how' is less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are "
#~ "cut off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an "
#~ "important advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had "
#~ "not yet considered. Our research into alien physiology has established "
#~ "that isolated specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and "
#~ "behave with little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but "
#~ "if a large enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each "
#~ "other -- or with alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a "
#~ "serious infiltration risk.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
#~ "approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation "
#~ "device or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
#~ "communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
#~ "linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue "
#~ "of inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"

#~ "The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "

#~ "direct control over every civilian and military detection asset in the "
#~ "solar system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so "

#~ "continuous detection coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system "
#~ "over the past two weeks. The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer "
#~ "than forty minutes at a time.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word "

#~ "We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at "
#~ "this time.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to "

#~ "the question of how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than "
#~ "it was before. If the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can "
#~ "they be delivering UFOs to Earth?\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about "
#~ "this issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem "
#~ "like crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the "
#~ "proof we needed.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we "
#~ "got our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space "
#~ "telescope. Upon watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array "
#~ "had accidentally managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full "
#~ "records in the visible and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class "
#~ "of UFO 'popping' into existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from "
#~ "Earth, from where it ignited its engines and set a course for the "
#~ "planet.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
#~ "that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we "
#~ "have strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, "
#~ "accompanied by a burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. "
#~ "There was not even the slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior "
#~ "to its appearance 10,000 klicks from Earth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do "
#~ "not need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of "
#~ "travel that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) "
#~ "drive allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well "
#~ "beyond our detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as "
#~ "it clearly violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. "
#~ "causality and/or special relativity), which remains the most accurate "
#~ "model of physics we have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we "
#~ "may study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this "
#~ "will not be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is "
#~ "paramount -- just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"

#~ "cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine "

#~ "Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"

#~ "but even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in "
#~ "there. If a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three "
#~ "tenths of a gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force "
#~ "of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried "
#~ "as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems "
#~ "present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A "
#~ "direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an "
#~ "explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough "
#~ "structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our "
#~ "interceptors. The only saving grace is that proton-antiproton explosions "
#~ "create little radioactive fallout.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection "
#~ "equipment, regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' "
#~ "part. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively "
#~ "absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with passive "
#~ "infrared and gamma radiation detection, as the antimatter-based engines "
#~ "produce quite a lot of both.\n"

#~ "Instead, every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the "

#~ "\n"
#~ "With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets "
#~ "in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a "
#~ "harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity "
#~ "compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had "
#~ "increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human "
#~ "armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the "
#~ "pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, "
#~ "and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
#~ "Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
#~ "reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though "
#~ "the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the "
#~ "new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of "
#~ "the late 20th century.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
#~ "designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
#~ "inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev "
#~ "pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a "
#~ "12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its "
#~ "excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its "
#~ "return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side "
#~ "of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out "
#~ "the other side.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices "
#~ "stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, "
#~ "which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, "
#~ "requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate "
#~ "or kill an enemy.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
#~ "minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's "
#~ "armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty "
#~ "alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in "

#~ "The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "

#~ "Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen "
#~ "service throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First "

#~ "infantry and ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as "
#~ "easily as from a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
#~ "Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large "
#~ "drum magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine "
#~ "endurance, but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The "
#~ "reloading process for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault "
#~ "rifle, and the drums contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be "
#~ "used almost as a heavy assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky "
#~ "side, but still small and light enough for an average soldier to carry "
#~ "several of them into battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a "
#~ "powerful recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to "
#~ "improve accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never "
#~ "going to be a sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its "
#~ "internals combine to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen "
#~ "action in Mumbai and performed admirably there, providing effective and "
#~ "highly mobile suppressive fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole "
#~ "alien squads depending on the terrain.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "

#~ "manglende evne Commonwealthtropper hadde til å lage en bulk i "
#~ "Mumbaioffensiven avdekket kritiske svakheter i dagens militære trening og "
#~ "utstyr. De mistet tre bataljoner bare på å bringe de utenomjordiske i stå "
#~ "uten å ha påført de betydelige tap. Falanksen må overvinne disse sjanser, "
#~ "og det gjør at vi trenger det aller beste den menneskelige teknologien "
#~ "har å tilby.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Excaliburprogrammet ble opprettet for å finne de mest effektive våpen på "
#~ "Jorden ved å gjennomgå deres produksjonsstandarder, holdbarhet, "
#~ "driftsrapporter og deres kamp ytelse i situasjoner der vi har klart å "
#~ "bringe de utenomjordiske til kamp.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Fra våre erfaringer i Mumbai og andre rammede byer har vi konkludert med "
#~ "at de utenomjordiske synes å konsentrere sin innsats mot tettsteder, "
#~ "spesielt tette byområder. Et flertall av engasjementer har foregått i "
#~ "knivkamprekkevidde. For formålene med Excalibur-programmet har vi valgt "
#~ "flere kraftige våpen til vår nærkamppakke.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Mange flotte hagler har kommet ut av Italia de siste to århundrer, den "
#~ "nyeste er Rossi AAA, en semi-automatisk kamp hagle utviklet for bruk av "
#~ "SWAT og anti-terrorist enheter. Den har flere banebrytende teknologi men "
#~ "den mest imponerende funksjonen er uten tvil det spesielt utviklede "
#~ "'Twist'-løpet. Twist er en ny type hagleløp som med en skarp vri ved "
#~ "håndgrepet kan endre stikke frem eller flate ned riflingen i løpet. Med "
#~ "denne mekanismen kan AAA endre sitt løp fra glattløpede til rifler og "
#~ "tilbake i en tiendedel av et sekund. Løpet justerer selv sine egne "
#~ "diameter og lufteventil for å passe enhver hylsetype i kammeret. Disse to "
#~ "nyvinninger gjør AAA i stand til å skyte enhver form for hagleammo på et "
#~ "øyeblikks varsel.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Den mest brukte militære og SWAT-ammunisjonen er 12mm centerfire "
#~ "flechette-skall. Hvert skall inneholder 8 bittesmå flechettes - solid "
#~ "stålpinner med finner for å stabilisere banen. Denne ammunisjonen har "
#~ "overlegen nøyaktighet i forhold til dyrehagl og fungerer glimrende mot "
#~ "armen vår. Flechettes-kulen er også utsatt for å rulle etter penetrasjon, "
#~ "noe som resulterer i imponerende skadeevne for et så lite prosjektil. "
#~ "Dens ulemper er sårbarhet for vindforhold og andre avbøyingsfaktorer. "
#~ "Andre typer ammunisjon er tilgjengelige for å håndtere disse "
#~ "situasjonene, og AAA kan skyte dem alle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Som konklusjon er Rossi AAA en svært allsidig hagle som er blant de mest "
#~ "effektive nærrekkeviddevåpen tilgjengelig. Den har lengre rekkevidde enn "
#~ "CRC-FL flammekaster og forårsaker mer skade enn CRC-8 SMG, som gir et "
#~ "godt kompromiss mellom fart, rekkevidde og bremsekraft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For falanksbruk har vi gitt denne hagle klassifisering CRC-212.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Anbefalt Lære\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "CRC-212 jobber veldig bra på nært hold men mister fort kraften etter "
#~ "hvert som avstanden øker. Flechetteskutt tenderer til å spre seg for "
#~ "langt til å være effektive (men i mindre grad enn vanlig dyrehagl), mens "
#~ "rifleslag lider av et markant prosjektilfall og er svært utsatt for vind. "
#~ "Selv om hagla kan skyte ut til middels rekkevidde, ikke forvent at det er "
#~ "veldig effektivt.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Der hvor dette våpenet virkelig vil komme til sin rett er i urbane "
#~ "situasjoner der fienden har lite å skjule seg bak og kan være engasjert "
#~ "på nært hold. Men det kan være for lang til å manøvrere riktig på trange "

#~ "The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
#~ "human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic "
#~ "weapon. We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with "
#~ "other existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my "
#~ "best to explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to "
#~ "a coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and "
#~ "generally poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising "
#~ "electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive projectile "
#~ "along two conducting rails. The electric current flowing through the "
#~ "rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile. "
#~ "The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current "
#~ "flowing through the rails and the projectile; this results in the rails "
#~ "and projectile pushing each other, thereby accelerating the projectile "
#~ "along the rails.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
#~ "stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
#~ "electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more "
#~ "compact in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light "
#~ "enough to create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-"
#~ "propellant firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme "
#~ "susceptibility to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every "
#~ "shot fired along them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the "
#~ "electric current cannot properly pass from the rails through the "
#~ "projectile. This causes successive shots to lose more and more of their "
#~ "power. Each round needs at least a short length of undamaged rail in "
#~ "order to build up velocity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by "
#~ "loading new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel "
#~ "has been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
#~ "conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
#~ "individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every "
#~ "round. This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the "
#~ "weapon to sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the "
#~ "current barrel have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly "
#~ "destroyed -- the soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to "
#~ "the ground, and slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery "
#~ "pack for a new series of shots.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, "
#~ "stamped from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with "
#~ "excellent armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside "
#~ "the target. The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger "
#~ "than their actual size.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
#~ "with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for "
#~ "each reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the "
#~ "other hand, the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical "
#~ "firearm in our arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a "
#~ "powerful assault weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-"
#~ "automatic or 4-round burst mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with "
#~ "many possible applications; its tactical value will certainly become "
#~ "apparent once we get some real combat experience with it.\n"

#~ "The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
#~ "troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers "
#~ "of the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on "
#~ "a soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any "
#~ "hoses or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister "

#~ "\n"
#~ "The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the "

#~ "The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and "
#~ "a deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area "

#~ "In fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and "
#~ "used again.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
#~ "balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds "
#~ "before the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the "
#~ "flashbang an excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling "
#~ "the enemy, especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From "
#~ "combat reports, we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect "
#~ "on aliens as they do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and "
#~ "deaf for a short time after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them "
#~ "helpless. We can't say exactly how long this period is, and it will "
#~ "undoubtedly vary from alien to alien, but it's still long enough to make "
#~ "the difference in a firefight.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
#~ "soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
#~ "alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons "
#~ "are applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage "
#~ "potential of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to "

#~ "distracted by a flashbang and could be engaged by fast-action troops "

#~ "century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have "

#~ "First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
#~ "numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its "
#~ "field. It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today "
#~ "because of its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive "
#~ "selection of compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
#~ "cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
#~ "reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising "
#~ "process, but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm "
#~ "speedloaders do exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard "
#~ "to carry around.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades "
#~ "at a set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
#~ "grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The "
#~ "RA6's maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or "
#~ "it can rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick "
#~ "three-round bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse "
#~ "Thermobaric) grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses "
#~ "atmospheric oxygen to generate an explosion instead of carrying along an "
#~ "oxidising agent. Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful "
#~ "explosive force than would be possible with conventional explosives of "
#~ "the same size. They rely on explosive energy, concussion and heat for "
#~ "their lethality rather than on fragmentation like most conventional "
#~ "explosives.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. "
#~ "While not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support "
#~ "weapon and infantry artillery piece.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
#~ "HPGL.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
#~ "range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used "
#~ "for special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be "
#~ "as effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
#~ "different tactics are required.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices "
#~ "some range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its "
#~ "benefits. The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade "
#~ "lands on an uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take "
#~ "cover before detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place "
#~ "his grenades exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic "
#~ "detonator failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the "
#~ "intended spot with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
#~ "corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
#~ "trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the "
#~ "operator doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops "
#~ "inside the blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with "
#~ "what's left of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they "
#~ "can also be a severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade "
#~ "launcher in situations where civilians might become victim to collateral "
#~ "damage is strongly discouraged.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no "
#~ "sidearm -- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette "
#~ "shells similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential "

#~ "\n"
#~ "Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for "
#~ "generations, and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part "
#~ "of a soldier's standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in "
#~ "electronics over the last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to "
#~ "shrink to the size of swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them "
#~ "on the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of "
#~ "a nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
#~ "darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "

#~ "civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of "
#~ "sight. Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be "
#~ "conclusive.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
#~ "will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
#~ "limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "

#~ "as long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that "

#~ "Detection range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them "
#~ "to sneak up on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot "
#~ "the approaching threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
#~ "exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our "

#~ "for the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly "

#~ "The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our "
#~ "combat knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've "
#~ "concluded it is much more than that, and the truth is far from "
#~ "comforting.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light "
#~ "and contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly "
#~ "interesting for our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it "
#~ "during testing, the blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might "
#~ "be able to duplicate the stuff with some more research.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, "
#~ "though perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. "
#~ "It's too large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The "
#~ "blade, however, tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be "
#~ "only one molecule wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting "
#~ "power.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
#~ "long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
#~ "that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
#~ "purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
#~ "Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
#~ "tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose "
#~ "of the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage "
#~ "from Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens "
#~ "were doing, until now.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to "
#~ "cut up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they "
#~ "like. The large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into "
#~ "the solar plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can "
#~ "opener. It goes through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point "
#~ "the alien will fold open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he "
#~ "needs.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too "
#~ "damned valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these "
#~ "Kerrblades are far more effective than any human combat knife. They cut "
#~ "up aliens almost as well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for "
#~ "human hands, but we can adapt human grips easily enough. However, the "
#~ "blades are too big to ever fit into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. "
#~ "They can only be kept in a soldier's hands or in the backpack. This "

#~ "the target isn't obscured or immune to highly-focused light or heat, the "
#~ "laser will burn through anything given enough time.\n"

#~ "All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. "
#~ "It's very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, "
#~ "he can adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's "
#~ "another bonus particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely "
#~ "high accuracy inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for "

#~ "the specs and deployment advice here for you.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From a technical standpoint, the electrolaser works on almost the same "
#~ "principles as natural lightning. It pumps electricity through a channel "
#~ "of ionised air -- what we refer to as a 'plasma channel' -- that is more "
#~ "conductive than the air around it, allowing the electricity to arc all "
#~ "the way to the target and then earth itself, causing severe shock damage. "
#~ "This plasma channel is created by a short, high-powered laser pulse which "
#~ "causes the air to begin ionising\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Electrolasers are a tried and true concept on Earth. They have a history "
#~ "of use going back several decades as less-than-lethal weapons. At their "
#~ "most basic, they are a 'taser without the wires', but until now they've "
#~ "suffered serious limitations due to battery capacity and the power levels "
#~ "required to knock out a soldier in insulated body armour. For this reason "
#~ "they've only ever been developed practically as single-shot disposables "
#~ "and close-range civilian weapons. Thanks to the output of our deuterium-"
#~ "fluoride lasers and energy systems, though, we've been able to go a lot "
#~ "further than that.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our electrolaser can project a stable plasma channel at short to medium "
#~ "ranges, depending on atmospheric conditions, and deliver previously "
#~ "unheard-of voltages to the target. It is effective against both organic "
#~ "and robotic enemies. It can be toggled to different power levels "
#~ "depending on the needs of the moment, from a simple stunning shock to "
#~ "full-blown electrocution which can kill weaker targets outright.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now for the cons.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The more powerful electrical systems and laser equipment have increased "
#~ "size and weight considerably compared to the stun rod, putting the "
#~ "electrolaser firmly in the Heavy Weapons category. Like all laser-based "
#~ "weapons it's affected by rain, fog, smoke and other conditions that "
#~ "thicken the air or release particles into it. Like all electric weapons, "
#~ "firing at airborne targets will produce limited results, unless they're "
#~ "close enough to an earthed object to allow the electricity to arc between "
#~ "them. In addition, any electrolaser needs the right kind of atmosphere to "
#~ "be able to create a plasma channel; taking them off of Earth could render "
#~ "them useless.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Another, more practical issue is the power unit. We couldn't quite "
#~ "achieve the desired power output profile using our standard deuterium-"
#~ "fluoride cartridges, so we've had to make adjustments to the ammunition "
#~ "package itself. I'm afraid this means that ammunition for the "
#~ "electrolaser is NOT interchangeable with ammunition for our regular laser "
#~ "weaponry.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Of course, no matter what the drawbacks might be, performance is light-"
#~ "years ahead of Dr. Connor's stun rod. I highly recommend we replace all "
#~ "stun rods currently in use with electrolasers as soon as humanly "
#~ "possible. For the sake of our troops, if nothing else.\n"

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
#~ "situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who "
#~ "could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw "
#~ "their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and "
#~ "hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or "
#~ "panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or "
#~ "materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action "
#~ "for weeks or months at a time.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, "
#~ "but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
#~ "contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by "
#~ "immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made "
#~ "as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving "
#~ "effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
#~ "directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
#~ "measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
#~ "combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
#~ "small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification "
#~ "purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or "
#~ "displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same "
#~ "time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools "
#~ "for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, "
#~ "and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by "
#~ "Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is "
#~ "almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in "
#~ "diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. "
#~ "They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the "
#~ "medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at "
#~ "appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove "
#~ "necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the "
#~ "victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer "
#~ "than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded "
#~ "troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of "
#~ "doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
#~ "made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
#~ "required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged "
#~ "in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed "
#~ "instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the "
#~ "operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever "
#~ "get.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in "
#~ "an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- "
#~ "but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All "
#~ "major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and "
#~ "further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she "
#~ "should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely "
#~ "receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
#~ "soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop "
#~ "from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further "
#~ "treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage "
#~ "approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable "
#~ "practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. "
#~ "Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield "
#~ "mathematics.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
#~ "take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
#~ "while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as "

#~ "This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
#~ "extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical "
#~ "skill to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
#~ "technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to "

#~ "as plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
#~ "magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
#~ "contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "

#~ "protects the plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the "
#~ "target. By the time a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic "
#~ "will be so eaten away that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, "
#~ "splashing its payload across the target. The maximum range of a pistol "
#~ "bolt -- the point it can reach before the plasma eats into open air and "

#~ "like water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will "
#~ "actually eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a "
#~ "large region around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be "
#~ "literally burnt to a crisp.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma "

#~ "blaster requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in "
#~ "and out of secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop "
#~ "with great strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it "
#~ "were a vehicle-mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. "
#~ "The magazines weigh nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated "
#~ "is hot enough to melt through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
#~ "increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
#~ "bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
#~ "distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but "
#~ "the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma "
#~ "chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per "
#~ "minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased "
#~ "thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly "
#~ "even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at "
#~ "all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that "
#~ "any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an "
#~ "extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine "
#~ "gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use "
#~ "is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like "

#~ "\n"
#~ "As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
#~ "sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing "
#~ "powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out "
#~ "hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
#~ "easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the "
#~ "barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a "
#~ "minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which "
#~ "lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds "
#~ "out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory "
#~ "from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't "
#~ "exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when "
#~ "firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough "
#~ "to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical "
#~ "obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to "
#~ "make the weapon much less effective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
#~ "electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
#~ "coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be "
#~ "too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have "
#~ "made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien "
#~ "engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM "
#~ "weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have "
#~ "anything concrete.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have "
#~ "incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and "
#~ "rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. "
#~ "Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight "
#~ "automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell "
#~ "the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this "
#~ "thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-"
#~ "sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own "
#~ "scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained "
#~ "package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our "
#~ "rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "
#~ "needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious "
#~ "casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a "
#~ "needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover "
#~ "and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an "

#~ "at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
#~ "chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat "
#~ "package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; "
#~ "the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed "
#~ "for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-"
#~ "breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt "
#~ "the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of "
#~ "shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can "
#~ "protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, "
#~ "the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a "
#~ "tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to "
#~ "fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow "
#~ "the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm "
#~ "centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- "
#~ "solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition "
#~ "has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently "
#~ "against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after "
#~ "penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small "
#~ "projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and "
#~ "other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with "
#~ "these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among "
#~ "the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range "
#~ "than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, "
#~ "providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"

#~ "The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power "

#~ "slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to "
#~ "wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't "
#~ "expect it to be very effective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
#~ "has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. "

#~ "Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
#~ "Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
#~ "principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
#~ "developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration "
#~ "('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located "
#~ "behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive "
#~ "20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which "
#~ "can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating "
#~ "breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases "
#~ "felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick "
#~ "repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are "
#~ "its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size "
#~ "class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a "
#~ "uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten "
#~ "and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-"
#~ "high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical "
#~ "urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 "
#~ "kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel "
#~ "rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where "
#~ "this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-"
#~ "advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet "
#~ "trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that "
#~ "keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on "
#~ "broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to "
#~ "fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien "
#~ "kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, "
#~ "the LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This "
#~ "weapon will not disappoint.\n"

#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"

#~ "life.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 "
#~ "or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens "

#~ "Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers "

#~ "The rifle seems to follow a very basic, modular design, quite unlike the "
#~ "plasma weapons we've already observed. All the parts can be slotted in or "
#~ "out of the weapon just by pressing an appropriately-located release "
#~ "catch. Strangely, none of the weapon's parts are particularly high-tech "
#~ "or impressive, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money "
#~ "and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the weapon's ammo "
#~ "supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, "
#~ "and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in "
#~ "order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely "
#~ "deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before "
#~ "we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our "
#~ "infantry armour. The high-energy particles in a particle beam travel so "
#~ "fast that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle "
#~ "armour. When fired at a suit of Combat Armour, the results are gruesome. "
#~ "It penetrates the front of the armour without even slowing down, and "
#~ "still has enough power to punch out the back and continue for several "
#~ "metres before dispersing.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Much heavier protection will be required for our troops to be able to "
#~ "stand up to this kind of fire. In addition to the development of entirely "
#~ "new armours, we should look into upgrading our current suits as soon as "
#~ "possible. We may suffer significant troop losses to alien PB weapons if "

#~ "why it was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy "

#~ "the issue that these weapons change everything.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
#~ "about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
#~ "themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
#~ "magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting "
#~ "the particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my "
#~ "fist. I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the "
#~ "'magazine', until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator "
#~ "of mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so "
#~ "small that we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The "
#~ "synchrotron speeds particles round and round in a very small circle -- "
#~ "less than the diameter of the magazine -- until they've achieved "
#~ "sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field "
#~ "into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- "
#~ "'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
#~ "complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the "
#~ "rest of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary "
#~ "to duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons "
#~ "works, and they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to "
#~ "use them we're going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, "
#~ "these little accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in "
#~ "their lifetimes, and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a "
#~ "few times. Our ammo supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we "
#~ "can recover in the field.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
#~ "obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
#~ "mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of "
#~ "magnitude greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have "
#~ "more numbers and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in "
#~ "fits and starts. It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you "

#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "

#~ "battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and "
#~ "return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's "
#~ "combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, "
#~ "though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th "
#~ "century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in "
#~ "World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through "
#~ "WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, "
#~ "kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only "
#~ "by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced "
#~ "types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern "
#~ "weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and "
#~ "its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
#~ "PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in "
#~ "the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every "
#~ "attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers "
#~ "at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in "
#~ "2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device "
#~ "called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds "
#~ "of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-"
#~ "production of spider silk.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
#~ "came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
#~ "Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar "
#~ "vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra "
#~ "high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
#~ "flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel "
#~ "and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between "
#~ "300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete "
#~ "after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the "
#~ "new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the "
#~ "world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so "
#~ "effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on "
#~ "the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further "
#~ "protect vital areas.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight "
#~ "compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers "
#~ "required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly "
#~ "distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than "
#~ "experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while "
#~ "preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"

#~ "soldiers, the Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to "
#~ "heavier, more advanced armours due to the freedom of movement it "

#~ "\n"
#~ "It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of "
#~ "a composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In "
#~ "fact, the most important element is something with which humanity is "
#~ "already well-acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known "
#~ "as CNTs or 'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are "
#~ "incredibly strong, one of the strongest materials known to humankind. "
#~ "They have been relatively little-used on Earth because of their extreme "
#~ "cost. No economical means of mass-production has been found to date, "
#~ "restricting their use to the most expensive programs on Earth, such as "
#~ "aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
#~ "stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
#~ "The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into "
#~ "a bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
#~ "effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
#~ "across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
#~ "fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
#~ "any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour "
#~ "performs very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, "
#~ "lasers and explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective "
#~ "against incendiary devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also "
#~ "raise the atmospheric temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the "
#~ "armour is left with no place to effectively dump its heat and will not "
#~ "protect the wearer as he roasts inside his suit.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the "

#~ "selectively applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking "

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare "
#~ "for a time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an "
#~ "important part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric "
#~ "habitation chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution "
#~ "units, and all the other apparatus required to sustain any "
#~ "extraterrestrial life that we could comprehend.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and "
#~ "keep extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their "
#~ "atmosphere generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full "
#~ "of any desired mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air "
#~ "for at least several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a "
#~ "specimen in our research programs. Trace elements that do not occur "
#~ "naturally on Earth may be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of "
#~ "this becoming an impediment to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-"
#~ "case scenario, the atmosphere generators are designed to allow links to "
#~ "recovered life support equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present "
#~ "in each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
#~ "chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
#~ "electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called "
#~ "\"panic button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the "
#~ "control room for every block of chambers. The panic button can "
#~ "immediately incinerate the contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
#~ "designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. "
#~ "The facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and "
#~ "samples for later review.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its "
#~ "full extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us "
#~ "to examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than "
#~ "the discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to "
#~ "learn their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
#~ "communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
#~ "and for all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
#~ "given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
#~ "there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the "
#~ "attacking EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete "
#~ "sedation is another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we "
#~ "will not win a war with half measures.\n"

#~ "To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
#~ "that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
#~ "PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
#~ "extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
#~ "perform up to its design spec."

#~ "\n"
#~ "Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit "
#~ "a new report.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It "
#~ "coordinates all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers "
#~ "and interprets data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room "
#~ "for mission planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) "
#~ "hub that launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can "
#~ "still operate without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, "
#~ "deaf and dumb; our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic "
#~ "control.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and "
#~ "state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by "
#~ "a gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment "
#~ "can't function without a power plant to supply it with enough "

#~ "The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX "
#~ "location. It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment "
#~ "and personnel to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a "
#~ "stairway that allow easy movement between base and surface. A small, "
#~ "camouflaged gatehouse is built on top for security and will also hide the "
#~ "entrance from flyovers. Like all our surface installations, it is coated "
#~ "with radar- and infrared-absorbing paints to reduce the chance of "
#~ "detection.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities "
#~ "in any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to "
#~ "gain access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a "
#~ "base, and should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre "
#~ "so that on-duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity "
#~ "without putting the CC at risk.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
#~ "assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose "
#~ "more tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually "
#~ "contains nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly "
#~ "sensitive to destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it "
#~ "is also quick and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can "

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
#~ "countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
#~ "start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
#~ "attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
#~ "aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-"
#~ "Air Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
#~ "batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien "
#~ "craft. Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen "
#~ "shoulder-mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop "
#~ "in acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again "
#~ "without a hitch.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
#~ "miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
#~ "study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What "
#~ "happened is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while "
#~ "dodging other incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all "
#~ "the way to its target.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We "
#~ "simply need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to "
#~ "adapt some old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new "
#~ "launchers. Our results are promising.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
#~ "engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. "
#~ "This is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than "
#~ "an airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky "
#~ "regardless of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency "
#~ "defence weapon on the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, "
#~ "but in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its "
#~ "electronics suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget "
#~ "range in the numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. "
#~ "Fortunately the UN has agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own "
#~ "strategic reserves at no cost to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to "
#~ "engage any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to "
#~ "attack the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. "
#~ "Assisting our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help "
#~ "take some of the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is "
#~ "simply no way to completely hide our missile launches despite our best "
#~ "attempts to camouflage them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away "
#~ "our position sooner or later.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
#~ "designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
#~ "longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for "
#~ "a follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
#~ "while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
#~ "enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
#~ "effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

#~ "\n"

#~ "This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the "
#~ "heavily-injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need "
#~ "advanced facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military "
#~ "hospital has available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in "
#~ "Mumbai hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the "
#~ "horrific bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must "
#~ "be better prepared than that.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the "
#~ "coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 "
#~ "and contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've "
#~ "had to completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the "
#~ "help of Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous "
#~ "management expected to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien "
#~ "weaponry I will never know.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We "
#~ "are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal "
#~ "and regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow "
#~ "itself through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, "
#~ "electrical nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly "
#~ "into the wound. Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living "
#~ "human being to full health in six weeks. This includes psychological "
#~ "evaluation and injury counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take "

#~ "surgery must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible "
#~ "for bionic upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye "
#~ "replacement may have a negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to "
#~ "kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is "
#~ "relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their "
#~ "primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at "

#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever "
#~ "since the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were "
#~ "forced to constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources "
#~ "(like hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were "
#~ "completely dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the "
#~ "grid went down. It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable "
#~ "full electrical autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring "
#~ "high-energy research.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a "
#~ "very efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a "
#~ "reactor that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain "
#~ "reaction. Instead it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case "
#~ "a particle accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases "
#~ "enough power to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power "
#~ "surplus that is redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste "
#~ "output will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only "
#~ "500 years. By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently "
#~ "used in nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium "
#~ "(Pu-239) and 700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste "
#~ "output is particularly easy to handle for the depleted element "
#~ "postprocessor integrated into the design. After a full trip through the "
#~ "postprocessor, the HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to "
#~ "human-safe levels of radioactivity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into "
#~ "a special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the "
#~ "coolant tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. "
#~ "This protects against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in "
#~ "case we completely lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
#~ "I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I "
#~ "understand the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough "
#~ "to fully meet the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with "
#~ "many high-energy buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be "
#~ "required, but a subsequent increase in base defences and security will be "
#~ "required to properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough "
#~ "fuel on-site for a decade of continued operation. A protected container "
#~ "is installed with every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
#~ "facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
#~ "exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
#~ "working at top performance.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending "
#~ "the power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we "
#~ "lose too much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider "
#~ "stepping down the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take "
#~ "a long time to get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able "
#~ "to operate any energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory "
#~ "equipment, even hangar lifts.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "

#~ "Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
#~ "designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, "
#~ "so I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
#~ "control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
#~ "around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
#~ "installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
#~ "coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather "
#~ "than simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien "
#~ "contacts. Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared "
#~ "and laser rangefinding.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
#~ "processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible "
#~ "information from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and "
#~ "should be present to supervise at all times; what the computers might "
#~ "dismiss as a radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester "
#~ "ready to hit a mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as "
#~ "much as software intelligence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the "
#~ "extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range "
#~ "as effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and "
#~ "range is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build "
#~ "further installations outside the base.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
#~ "reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight "
#~ "plan and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required "
#~ "to log their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if "
#~ "the various militaries will be very conscientious in following that "
#~ "directive.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "

#~ "\n"
#~ "Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there "

#~ "Considering the number of other military radar sources around, it's "
#~ "unlikely that alien craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated "
#~ "backtrace. At most they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
#~ "our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission "
#~ "under any circumstances.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
#~ "and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
#~ "UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
#~ "facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "

#~ "It is based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived "
#~ "from alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The "

#~ "\n"

#~ "dumps. In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic "
#~ "security system which will lock down the instant containment drops below "

#~ "\n"
#~ "I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
#~ "generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight "
#~ "tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be "
#~ "the finest piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
#~ "Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
#~ "pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
#~ "turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at "
#~ "supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a "
#~ "sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in "
#~ "front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to "
#~ "harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the "
#~ "heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours "
#~ "before burning through all their fuel.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
#~ "deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to "
#~ "Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and "
#~ "a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto "
#~ "well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise "
#~ "ability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
#~ "the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its "
#~ "hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the "
#~ "target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and "
#~ "acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even "
#~ "complete.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. "
#~ "The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a "
#~ "state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- "
#~ "but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar "
#~ "system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM "
#~ "emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off "
#~ "missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints "
#~ "can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to "
#~ "accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a "
#~ "premium.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
#~ "Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, "
#~ "its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, "
#~ "within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
#~ "recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
#~ "described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
#~ "deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium "
#~ "wing mounts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
#~ "threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe "
#~ "with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be "
#~ "deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its "
#~ "hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the "
#~ "flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the "
#~ "combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, "
#~ "but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat "
#~ "comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the "

#~ "\n"
#~ "It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific "
#~ "aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our "
#~ "planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's "
#~ "operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all "
#~ "the UFOs we might detect.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap "
#~ "we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" "
#~ "in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single "
#~ "airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in "
#~ "its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in "
#~ "radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, "
#~ "lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed "
#~ "almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced "
#~ "plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough "
#~ "to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. "
#~ "The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range "
#~ "into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
#~ "efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its "
#~ "hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for "
#~ "combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe "
#~ "allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply "
#~ "be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one "
#~ "engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional "
#~ "manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; "
#~ "this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
#~ "targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
#~ "(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the "
#~ "pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load "
#~ "of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular "
#~ "equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
#~ "and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. "
#~ "The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less "
#~ "expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's "
#~ "manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to "
#~ "change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic "
#~ "wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) "
#~ "and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing "
#~ "aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much "
#~ "more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not "
#~ "perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"

#~ "most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to "

#~ "Harvester UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other "
#~ "mission somewhere else.\n"

#~ "It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly "
#~ "fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the "
#~ "side to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter "
#~ "engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. "
#~ "This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require "
#~ "thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about "
#~ "it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this "
#~ "weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good "
#~ "fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the "
#~ "atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them "
#~ "harmless.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied "
#~ "these intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a "
#~ "pilot, a gunner and an electronics officer. The Fighter features no "
#~ "discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. "
#~ "What it does have, however, is a large targeting computer and holographic "
#~ "HUD to make the craft even more effective in air engagements.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led "
#~ "us to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While "
#~ "faster than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very "
#~ "speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of "
#~ "the alien hull materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if "
#~ "required. The aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with "
#~ "their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel "
#~ "volatility.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "
#~ "armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The "
#~ "few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry "
#~ "seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. "
#~ "If the UFO does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in "
#~ "its tanks will not be enough to harm other craft in the same formation. "
#~ "This might not be true for larger craft, however.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most "
#~ "often operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, "
#~ "effective formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, "

#~ "Here is my summary for your review.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien "
#~ "medical technology. It makes only a few concessions to air combat. Its "
#~ "main purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry "
#~ "out hideous operations on human victims.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human "
#~ "biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood "
#~ "transfusion banks -- are geared towards the capture and alteration of "
#~ "complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are "
#~ "still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem "
#~ "to be used to store some kind of heavy alien robot or cargo equipped with "
#~ "tank treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these "
#~ "robots in place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of "
#~ "air-drop mechanism as well.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It's difficult to speculate exactly what exactly goes on in these UFOs "
#~ "with regards to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with "
#~ "the alien harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for "
#~ "that which do not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to "
#~ "suspect that the Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity "
#~ "on Earth. Something has changed. Until we fully understand what's "
#~ "happening, we need to prepare ourselves for what could be the worst "
#~ "threat to the global population we've ever seen.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In the air the Corrupter's performance is relatively poor, being slow and "
#~ "sluggish compared to other UFOs, but from our observations it appears to "
#~ "be heavily escorted and presents a major ground threat due to its large "
#~ "crew complement and on-board heavy weapons. More than any other craft "
#~ "we've encountered, the Corrupter is purpose-built to deliver large alien "
#~ "forces to the surface solely to attack civilians.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, it's painfully obvious that we need to shoot these things down "
#~ "whenever and wherever we see them. If we don't, it's going to result in "

#~ "\n"
#~ "We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal "
#~ "about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs "
#~ "twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of "
#~ "heavy fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very "
#~ "interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost "
#~ "identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. It seems like the "
#~ "aliens have actually adapted our design for their own use and may begin "
#~ "using different loadouts on individual craft. If the aliens are actually "
#~ "learning from us, we could be in for a hell of a ride . . .\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Even more interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the "
#~ "standard skin of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading "
#~ "UFOs. This new armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and "
#~ "various other substances designed to slow and stop projectiles from "
#~ "penetrating. The basic principle is simple enough but the new compounds "
#~ "have interesting properties which we're not sure we fully understand. "
#~ "I'll see if my team can make anything of it and, if so, I'll have a new "
#~ "research proposal ready for you soon.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The fuselage design of the Gunboat is still ostensibly that of a "
#~ "spacecraft, but it has certain adaptations that make it much easier to "
#~ "handle in atmosphere. It has actual wing surface generating lift, unlike "
#~ "the small claw-winged designs which relied on brute engine power to stay "
#~ "airborne. Furthermore, mobile flaps on the wings and stabilisers -- much "
#~ "like on human aircraft -- allow the Gunboat to use the airflow over its "
#~ "surfaces, giving it a much tighter turning circle, a far higher angle of "
#~ "attack and a tremendous rate of climb compared to a UFO moving on engine "
#~ "power alone.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overall the Gunboat is fast, manoeuvrable and utterly deadly. It seems to "
#~ "outperform previously-observed UFOs on every level; faster, tougher, "
#~ "better-armed and more nimble. The only positive is that it would take "
#~ "three or four times as much material to build a Gunboat compared to a "
#~ "small attack craft and twice as much fuel to keep it flying, so it's "
#~ "unlikely we'll see Gunboats in large numbers. My only worry is that they "
#~ "won't need very many of these to pound us into dust. Extreme caution is "
#~ "advised, Commander, and I recommend we spend some time and money "
#~ "upgrading our airfleet as soon as we can.\n"

#~ "Here is my summary for your review.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
#~ "specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
#~ "harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
#~ "and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
#~ "(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's "
#~ "crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they "
#~ "return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to "
#~ "wherever it is they came from.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being "
#~ "the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster "
#~ "than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more "
#~ "antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, "
#~ "thicker armour, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. "
#~ "Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will be contained by "
#~ "the UFO's extremely strong construction.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
#~ "possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "
#~ "full.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around "
#~ "the craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam "
#~ "weapon we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an "
#~ "interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly "
#~ "sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by matter-antimatter "
#~ "reaction rockets similar to UFO engines. These missiles are insanely "
#~ "fast, so fast that they don't need explosive warheads to kill their prey, "
#~ "relying solely on kinetic impact and the sympathetic detonation of any "
#~ "remaining fuel. More research into this weapon will be a high priority.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
#~ "priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, "
#~ "its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. "
#~ "Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared to smaller UFO "
#~ "types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more "
#~ "combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of "
#~ "the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, and it would be wise to "
#~ "upgrade our equipment in order to mitigate some of the aliens' tech "
#~ "superiority.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots and craft on any "
#~ "Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then "
#~ "should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some "
#~ "frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster "
#~ "as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if "
#~ "they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. "
#~ "Without upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more "
#~ "dangerous threats in the future.\n"

#~ "My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
#~ "Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and "
#~ "apprehensive, they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified "
#~ "out of their minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers "
#~ "didn't even speak the language, unable to understand what was said. When "
#~ "they asked what was wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- "
#~ "the Hindi term for 'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
#~ "shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
#~ "\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
#~ "that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say "
#~ "with confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than "
#~ "fire and darkness.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
#~ "almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
#~ "visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. "
#~ "The subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the "
#~ "'thumb') is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and "
#~ "possesses a thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, "
#~ "and so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans "
#~ "have carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most "
#~ "interesting part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The "
#~ "creature has a total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very "
#~ "tough plant matter. It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This "
#~ "implies that, wherever they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding "
#~ "on some kind of plant life. This finding has comforted some of our more "
#~ "excitable staff. At least we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our "
#~ "meat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will "
#~ "require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more "
#~ "detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. "
#~ "It has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
#~ "sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to "
#~ "hit the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or "
#~ "even permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is "
#~ "actually caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which "
#~ "hardens over the supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. "
#~ "This makes a Taman fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but "
#~ "not enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
#~ "prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
#~ "the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
#~ "badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly "
#~ "vulnerable to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
#~ "appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a "
#~ "kind of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution "
#~ "(two different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. "
#~ "There are very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that "
#~ "of humans, and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders "
#~ "of magnitude more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a "
#~ "hypothetical common origin.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
#~ "can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
#~ "soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
#~ "positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons "
#~ "and advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other "
#~ "species. This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs "
#~ "and delicate manipulators.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
#~ "couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been "
#~ "able to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The "

#~ "stealth technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect "
#~ "your presence later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, "
#~ "your enemy can't shoot what he can't see.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "

#~ "effect of ECM. And one thing is clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, "

#~ "One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to "

#~ "unavoidable. PHALANX uses exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even "
#~ "though it's possible for our interceptors to land on only one engine, the "
#~ "loss of an engine during combat will immediately render the aircraft "
#~ "combat-ineffective. With such a drastic loss of speed and manoeuvring "
#~ "power, continuing the engagement would be suicide\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution "

#~ "possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
#~ "vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "

#~ "\n"
#~ "The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "

#~ "the Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this "

#~ "Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would "
#~ "surely need it for navigation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered "
#~ "so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface "

#~ "Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser "
#~ "rapidly loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At "
#~ "maximum range, 5 kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on "
#~ "the same spot to hole a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much "
#~ "time to wait for a kill. The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to "
#~ "3 kilometres where it strikes a good balance between damage and distance. "
#~ "Average damage per second at these distances is slightly less than the "
#~ "SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so "
#~ "than any of our previous weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for "
#~ "driving and pinning down the enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing "
#~ "up to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are "
#~ "both too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to "
#~ "large off-base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not "
#~ "need to keep laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like "
#~ "to recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our "
#~ "airfleet except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. "
#~ "Anything that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty "

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
#~ "need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these "
#~ "alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of "
#~ "the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence "
#~ "of our planet.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
#~ "Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
#~ "dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
#~ "produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
#~ "efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 "
#~ "rounds a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
#~ "failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
#~ "discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
#~ "long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
#~ "constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
#~ "Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power "
#~ "of this weapon became apparent.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
#~ "effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The "
#~ "rate of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. "
#~ "Its sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as "
#~ "long as there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The "
#~ "unlinked ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded "
#~ "throughout the gun's service history.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
#~ "Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves "
#~ "better penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is "
#~ "achieved. Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO "
#~ "armour to some degree.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited "
#~ "damage to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to "
#~ "bring a target down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of "
#~ "opportunity to escape or peg our craft with return fire. On the other "
#~ "hand, its large magazine gives it more staying power than most other "
#~ "weapons, and it is not to be underestimated.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's "
#~ "usefulness. However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated "
#~ "if the gun is used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles "
#~ "armament. It can provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot "
#~ "concentrates on delivering his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat "
#~ "configuration -- one or more interceptors loaded with as many cannons as "
#~ "possible, bringing down a UFO by sheer weight of lead.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way "
#~ "to engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
#~ "capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best "
#~ "dogfighting gun Earth has to offer.\n"

#~ "potential.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
#~ "been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in "
#~ "for the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the "
#~ "pilot had left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a "

#~ "out of the sky with rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-"
#~ "land. He returned to his airbase two days later without a scratch on "
#~ "him.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that "
#~ "they can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the "
#~ "rockets are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each "

#~ "We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving "

#~ "In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, tearing "
#~ "mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster "
#~ "opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single "
#~ "round on the target.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and "
#~ "mostly in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a "
#~ "single UFO with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target "
#~ "into his wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which "
#~ "point the wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more "

#~ "air-to-air efficiency.\n"

#~ "Ny informasjon har kommet fram under siste parti av obduksjoner du "
#~ "etterspurte. Våre rapporter står, men vi har oppdaget et fellestrekk som "
#~ "kan gi oss noen ny innsikt i de de fremmedes mangfold.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Under våre første analyser av de fremmedes cellestruktur møtte vi noen "
#~ "uregelmessigheter hvor våre DNA-replikasjonstester mislyktes på grunn av "
#~ "uforklarlige prøvekontaminering. Opprinnelig forkastet vi dette som "

#~ "som ikke har vært kryogenisk frosset for lagring har vi vanskeligheter "
#~ "med å å trekke ut en eneste ukontaminert sekvens. Det gav ikke noen "
#~ "mening inntil vår nylige oppdagelse av XVI-infeksjonen i sivile "
#~ "mennesker. Jeg mistenkte straks en sammenheng, men ville vente til jeg "
#~ "kunne bevise det, og siden da har jeg tilbrakt de fleste av mine fritimer "
#~ "til å studere problemet. Nå tror jeg at jeg har funnet årsaken.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Den enkleste forklaringen er denne: Det finnes to typer DNA i våre "
#~ "blodprøver. Den fremmede DNAs utbredelsen er totalt; disse sekvensene kan "
#~ "finnes i hvert eneste medlem av Taman artene, og nærmere undersøkelse har "
#~ "bekreftet at lignende sekvenser finnes i blodet hos andre arter vi har "
#~ "gjenvunnet. Kilden virker å være en slags enkeltcellulær organisme "
#~ "tilstede i stort antall i det fremmede blodet. Det finnes flere versjoner "
#~ "av den, en for hver art av fremmede, og de deler alle bemerkelsesverdige "
#~ "DNA likheter. Interessant, selv om disse organismene har alle et identisk "
#~ "antall kromosomer, kan ingen av dem overleve i en kropp som ikke er "
#~ "medlem av dets kilde arter. Også merkelig er det faktum at det er "
#~ "absolutt ingen variasjoner i DNA mellom organismer av samme versjon. "
#~ "Dette leder oss til å tro at de forskjellige versjonene kan ha blitt "
#~ "konstruert - helt eller delvis - å passe de enkelte artene.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Vi antar at alle romvesen bærer en versjon av denne mikroorganiske "
#~ "infeksjonen. Organismens funksjon er ikke åpenbar. Vi har kjørt tester på "
#~ "ulike eksperimentelle vevsprøver, både infiserte og kontrollprøver. De "
#~ "infiserte vev synes ikke å lide noen negative effekter - eller positive "
#~ "virkninger for den saks skyld - fra organismens nærvær. De er i hovedsak "
#~ "umulig å skille fra friske vev. Siden organismen krever en levende vert "
#~ "for sin egen overlevelse, synes det å være enten en parasitt eller en "
#~ "symbiose med for tiden uobserverte fordeler.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Vi har kalt denne organismen 'Extraterrestrial Virusinfeksjon ', eller "
#~ "XVI. Dette kan være misvisende i mikrobiologiske vilkår; XVI er en "
#~ "kompleks flercellede organisme langt større enn noe jordisk virus, men "
#~ "det fungerer og replikerer akkurat som et. Derfor føler vi at begrepet er "
#~ "berettiget. Ettersom hver fremmed art har en unik tråd av infeksjonen har "
#~ "vi gitt dem alfabetiske betegnelser etter kilde artene der tråden blir "
#~ "funnet. Tamans har XVI-T, Shevaar har XVI-S, og så videre.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Infeksjonens formål er fortsatt uklart På dette tidspunktet, men det er "
#~ "det eneste vi har funnet så langt som binder disse forskjellige rasene "
#~ "sammen fysisk. Vi kan bare anta at nye tråder på infeksjonen ble "
#~ "konstruert for å passe hver enkelt art, kanskje noe som tillater dem å "
#~ "eksistere slik de gjør.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Det er ingen indikasjon på at denne organismen er smittsom for mennesker. "
#~ "Når det injisere kulturer av menneskelig vev med frisk fremmed blod, har "
#~ "vi observert fremmed blod blir helt avvist, som forventet. Uventet var "
#~ "det imidlertid at alle spor av smitte senere ble tilintetgjort av "
#~ "standard menneskelige T-celler. Organismen klarte ikke å slå rot i møte "
#~ "med vårt immunsystem.\n"

#~ "La meg begynne med å oppgi noen stygge realiteter. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "1) Alle menneskehetens rombaserte eiendeler har blitt evakuert etter de "
#~ "første angrep på Jorden. Bare et fåtall stasjoner og utposter er "
#~ "fremdeles i gang, og de er blitt underlagt militær kontroll, med bare "
#~ "minimalt mannskap av frivillig militært og sivilt personell. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "2) Vi har bare en håndfull rombaserte våpenplattformer, hvorav ingen er "
#~ "utstyrt for å kunne skade fremmede fartøyer. Romvesenene har evnen til å "
#~ "øyeblikkelig utrydde eventuelle menneskelige bestrebelser i "
#~ "solsystemet. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "3) Vårt satellittnett er vidåpne og kan tørkes av kartet på et øyeblikk. "
#~ "Beredskaps-fasttelefoner eksisterer, men kun for militært bruk. Hvis "
#~ "nettet blir angrepet vil kommunikasjonen mellom Falanks' kommandosentre "
#~ "og eiendeler i felten - fly og bakkelag - bli rammet \n"
#~ ".\n"
#~ "4) Det er ingen tvil om at det er fremmede fartøyer som beveger seg i "
#~ "bane, lastet med gjenstander og Ufoer mellom Jorden og den fremmede "
#~ "hjemplaneten, og akkurat nå er det ingenting vi kan gjøre for å stoppe "
#~ "dem. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Dette leder oss til én konklusjon: Rommet rundt Jorden er ikke lenger "
#~ "under vår kontroll. Den eneste grunnen til at menneskeheten beholder noe "
#~ "kontroll i det hele tatt er fordi romvesenene har valgt å ikke ødelegge "
#~ "det ennå. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Vår sjokkerende sårbarhet fra rommet er demonstrert i det faktum at vi "
#~ "har kjempet denne krigen utelukkende på bakken og i luften. Vi har ingen "
#~ "romfly som kan tilpasses for kamp, og design for å bygge dem er år fra "
#~ "ferdigstillelse. Ikke engang Falanks kunne lage et brukbart kampfly i "
#~ "tide til å påvirke utfallet av krigen med den teknologien vi for tiden "
#~ "har til rådighet. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Hvilke lite omløp våpen vi har er sterkt mangelfulle. Det finnes "
#~ "kjernefysiske raketter som FN ikke vil la oss bruke, og som ville være "
#~ "altfor ødeleggende for å hjelpe vår forskningsinnsats dersom en av de "
#~ "kolossale tingene noensinne klarte å score et treff. Det er "
#~ "eksperimentelle laser og Maser plattformer som er for underdimensjonert "
#~ "til selv det å lage en bulk i tung Ufo-rustning. Hvis romvesenene "
#~ "beslutter at de ønsker å bombe oss inn i utryddelse kan de bare lene litt "
#~ "på fingrene. Dette er en situasjon som må rettes. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Det eneste spørsmålet vi kan spørre om denne orbitale Ufo-aktiviteten er "
#~ "hvordan vi skal møte den. Inntil nå har vi ikke vært i stand til å "
#~ "påvirke situasjonen, men med budsjettøkninger og vårt voksende rykte i FN "
#~ "er biter begynt å falle på plass for et nytt steg i vår strategi. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Den klart mest lovende idé for et kortsiktig orbitalt responsvåpen er å "
#~ "tilpasse en av romvåpnene som brukes av NASA og den europeiske "
#~ "romfartsorganisasjonen til å lansere satellitter og - før invasjonen "
#~ "tvang oss til å evakuere våre interplanetariske installasjoner - avfyre "
#~ "forsyningspakker mot Tranquilitybasen på månen. Disse romvåpnene er "
#~ "essensielt gigantiske \"railguns\" med nok strøm til å sende en "
#~ "satellittstor nyttelast i bane. Med vårt bibliotek med FNs forskning på "
#~ "elektromagnetiske våpen kan vi oppgradere ett av disse våpnene til et "
#~ "antiorbitalt våpen i stand til å slå fremmede skip ut av himmelen. Vi er "
#~ "sikre på at vi kan overbevise minst ett av jordens romorganisasjoner å "
#~ "låne oss et egnet våpen for jobben. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Det er imidlertid noen problemer. Tydeligvis kan ikke disse våpnene "
#~ "bevege seg under bygging inn i siden av et fjell, så målet måtte passere "
#~ "rett foran våpenet for at vi skal ha en sjanse til å treffe den. Siden vi "
#~ "ikke kan stole på romvesenene å gi oss et direkteskudd, har dette vært en "
#~ "stor snublestein, men vi tror det kan være en løsning: Hvis våpenet ikke "
#~ "kan bevege seg for å treffe noe, må kulene bevege seg i stedet. \n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Planen for utvikling av en spesiell hylse som er i stand til å justere "
#~ "sin egen bane med en rekke innebygde raketter. Vi har presser for tiden "
#~ "FN for å la oss bruke et miniatyr kjernefysisk stridshode - ikke mer enn "
#~ "3 kilotonn - for å sikre at eventuelle treff vil drepe. Dette orbitale "
#~ "skallet vil bli store, tunge, og et helvete av en utfordring å laste inn "
#~ "i våpenet, men det er absolutt nødvendig for å gi prosjektet en "
#~ "realistisk mulighet til å lykkes.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Som du ser kan disse problemene alle være overvunnet, men vi trenger å "
#~ "gjøre en del alvorlig forskning og utvikling og forplikter en god del "
#~ "finansiering for å få det hele til å fungerer. Vennligst gi din "

#~ "Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, "
#~ "\"If it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in "
#~ "design to the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises "
#~ "and delicate balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the "
#~ "torso and head, the medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with "
#~ "much more dense nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and "
#~ "sensitive nerve clusters. In comparison with the alien body armour, the "
#~ "medium suit has double the number of nanotube strands per square "
#~ "centimetre. As a result these plates are nearly impenetrable to standard "
#~ "human firearms and even the softer mesh covering the joints can stop "
#~ "bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
#~ "mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
#~ "race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so "
#~ "heavy that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are "
#~ "numerous mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some "
#~ "of the weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are "
#~ "integrated into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite "
#~ "interesting and we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as "
#~ "weapon enhancements.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against "
#~ "humanity in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance "
#~ "against lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the "
#~ "Alien Body Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle "
#~ "beams. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from "
#~ "crossing open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged "
#~ "exposure will still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
#~ "skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
#~ "remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its "
#~ "full effect.\n"
#~ "\n"

#~ "Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. "
#~ "Here is a summary of my report.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
#~ "core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
#~ "specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
#~ "course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
#~ "astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use "
#~ "of this alien hardware.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
#~ "astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
#~ "system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
#~ "intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel "
#~ "time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. "
#~ "These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the "
#~ "exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-"
#~ "light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the "
#~ "theory that the aliens do inneed have access to some type of FTL "
#~ "technology.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a "
#~ "star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We "
#~ "have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. "
#~ "Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would "
#~ "surely need it for navigation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered "
#~ "so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface "
#~ "maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-"
#~ "undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrom analyses of every body in the "
#~ "asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every "
#~ "body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're "
#~ "not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will "
#~ "greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- "
#~ "whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It's possible to pråkram our own star charts into the astrogation unit, "
#~ "but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be "
#~ "compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar "
#~ "travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in "
#~ "the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the "
#~ "solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into "
#~ "space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary "
#~ "travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or "
#~ "even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "And that is something we should do as soon as humanly possible.\n"
