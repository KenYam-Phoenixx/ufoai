"Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
"succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
"achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
"battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to "
"lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical "
"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman "
"to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to "
"those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement "
"by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our "
"custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or "
"radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back "
"into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the "
"system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow "
"damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop "
"functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
"beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
"required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied "
"to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new "
"proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Our collected UN research files have yielded a lot of valuable information "

"than a projectile. We are particularly interested in the files on Continuous "
"Wave Lasers.\n"
"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers "

"Our study on antimatter is complete, Commander, and we're ready to present "
"our results. I'm afraid the news is mostly bad.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of things the aliens know that we don't. Nowhere is this "
"more clear in their widespread use of antimatter. It seems to be plentiful "
"for them, at least plentiful enough to send out UFO after UFO to Earth, "
"burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into antimatter, on the "
"other hand . . .\n"
"\n"
"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of "
"anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near "
"Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not long after, another "
"lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come slowly forward over the "
"years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by "
"the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
"availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with "
"every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
"antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
"gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a "
"Scout UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over "
"the past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Another worrying point is that the aliens also seem to be using antimatter "
"as part of their weapons systems. Antimatter-fuelled alien missiles are one "
"thing; what if they begin using antimatter itself as an explosive? My staff "
"has come up with more than one disconcerting idea along these lines. For "
"myself, I think we should try to head the aliens off at the pass in this "
"regard. A special program regarding antimatter-based weapons may be a highly "
"interesting option to pursue -- it may be a more economical prospect than "
"trying to adapt alien rockets to our interceptor craft.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in "
"the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom "
"line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they "
"create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to "
"do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts "
"will be fruitless. Our only major successes have come from studying how the "
"aliens store their antimatter. We are confident we can employ the same "
"magnetic storage techniques, creating special protective pallets that will "
"fit in our Storage facilities without any further adaptations, and we've "
"designed antimatter fuel tanks that will fit in our interceptors, given some "
"major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full understanding of the alien "
"engines before we can begin incorporating it.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If "
"we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering "
"it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may "
"have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we "
"are to have any chance of truly stopping the invasion.\n"

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to "
"our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these "
"mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies "
"seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "

"Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do "

"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication "
"with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies "
"confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that "
"we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently "

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, if such experiments were to be approved by the Base Commander, I "
"assure you that my team would take full precautions. Nothing is more "
"important to us than the lives of our men and the security of our "
"facilities.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders "
"of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only "
"thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do "
"what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing "
"from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these "
"points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they "
"go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "
"anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The "
"region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars "
"and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the "
"stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have "
"been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There "
"has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various "
"base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar "
"system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien "
"activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we "
"have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien "
"movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind "
"Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if "
"they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough "
"eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"This project will take a significant amount of funding and lab-time, "
"Commander, so it requires your authorisation before work can begin.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, "
"the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our "
"arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault "
"weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst "
"mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its "
"tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat "
"experience with it.\n"

"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "
"they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat "
"knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's "
"sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two "
"weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in "
"lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a "
"sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee "
"combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"Commander, now that we've had a good look at the alien blade technology from "
"several sources -- the Bloodspider's 'fangs' and the Kerrblade -- we're "
"starting to form a picture of how to recreate the unknown or ill-understood "
"materials used in their construction.\n"
"\n"
"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the "
"alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a "
"razor, and yet shock-resistant and flexible enough to survive the stresses "
"of melee combat. Once forged they are nearly impossible to break, nick or "
"bend. Applying a hammer and chisel directly to the blade just means you end "
"up with two neatly-sliced halves of a chisel.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously it would be of great interest to us if we could create our own "
"knives made from these materials, with edges tapering to the width of a "
"single molecule. My team and I believe it may now be possible.\n"
"\n"
"If you give us the funding and lab time we need, we can design and create a "
"new monomolecular combat knife that will even the playing field for our "
"soldiers when forced into hand-to-hand combat. This knife will be far more "
"compact than the Kerrblade and much easier for humans to wield, and it'll be "
"small enough to be used one-handed.\n"
"\n"
"Equipping our troops with such weapons could give them a major advantage, as "
"they'll be able to properly defend themselves in melee for the first time "
"whilst using other weapons or equipment -- such as pistols, grenades, "
"medikits, or other useful items of tactical or life-saving importance.\n"

"\n"
"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was "
"first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or "
"metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th "
"century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made "
"them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: "
"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we’ve selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the "
"lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 "
"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "
"may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to "
"work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important "
"attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Though quite effective against enemy infantry, frag grenades are weapons of "
"opportunity, not a replacement for firearms or portable artillery. Their "

"situation calls for close-range indirect fire or something deadly thrown "
"around a corner, the frag grenade is just the thing.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in "
"the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is "
"strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be "

"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"\n"
"This is a box of 9 25mm incendiary grenades. They are fired electronically "
"by a spark igniter inside the launcher's barrel. These grenades are area-"
"denial weapons, covering a large stretch of ground with very hot flames that "
"are almost impossible to extinguish. The compound itself is a modification "
"of a mixture that has been in use since World War II; thermite, barium "
"nitrate, sulphur and binding agent. And thanks to modern miniaturisation "
"technology, it will all fit into a handy, lightweight 25mm shell.\n"
"\n"
"These grenades are meant to be loaded into an HPGL Grenade Launcher.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"

"For this project, we already had ready access to all the required "
"technology. We've made very few changes to the general design of the "
"grenade. The only real challenge was to shrink the complex machinery enough "
"to fit inside a standard 25mm shell. We've had to scale back the power of "
"the plasma grenade somewhat in order to do that -- the hydrogen core of our "
"new 25mm shell is a fair bit smaller, emitting less plasma than the alien "
"hand grenade. However, this is offset by the fact that it can be fired en "
"masse from our HPGL Grenade Launcher over relatively long distances.\n"
"\n"
"We've dubbed our creation the 25mm PB ('Plasma Burst') Grenade. We can "
"manufacture them by the box or by the speedloader, both of which will be "
"extremely expensive to produce. One full load of 25mm PB is essentially an "
"entire magazine of miniature plasma grenades, miniatures which are even more "
"difficult to create than the original.\n"

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it "
"prototyped and ready to go into production at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. "
"In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous "
"wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and "
"far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine "
"have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's "
"very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. "
"It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire "
"or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It "
"can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of "
"continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on "
"hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of "
"material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to "
"be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care "
"will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the "
"path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam "
"will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in "
"permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field "
"officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every "
"turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"Robotic or armoured aliens may be able to survive a beam for some time, even "
"from a heavy laser, before their armour fails. It's recommended to engage "
"these with several soldiers at once and concentrate fire in order to bring "
"them down as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"It's also recommended that you not replace all our conventional heavy "
"weapons with heavy lasers, Commander. We need a good balance of weapons to "
"play to the strengths of our troops and to the weaknesses of the aliens. A "
"varied arsenal is a healthy arsenal, and can't be easily defended against.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, "
"and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's "
"standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the "
"last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of "
"swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "
"Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
"will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "
"aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection "
"range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up "
"on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching "
"threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
"exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. "
"However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 "
"Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "
"engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man "
"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most "
"of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing "
"them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty "
"inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this "
"penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire "
"consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting "
"available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this "
"message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working "
"on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm "
"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "
"fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste "
"gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down "
"even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the "
"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"
"strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a "
"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate "
"the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or "
"immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything "
"given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus "
"particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy "
"inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use "
"two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "
"which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses "
"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "
"other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't "
"powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the "
"laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy "
"that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for "
"a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to "
"the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without "
"reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"
"\n"
"We will need to have at least one D-F Cartridge on hand at all times in "
"order to be able to load and use a laser pistol.\n"

"This rifle is possibly the most accurate weapon ever designed. It's light, "

"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "

"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "

"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "

"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "

"survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP "
"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff "
"into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs "
"between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost "
"certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will "
"appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the "
"control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual "

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon "
"family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster "
"requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of "
"secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great "
"strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-"
"mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh "
"nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt "
"through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
"increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
"bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
"distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the "
"blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and "
"upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. "
"Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, "
"the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme "
"close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which "
"PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found "
"carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone "
"and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun "
"and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is "
"almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most "
"humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and "
"require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the "
"development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's "
"inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is "
"documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to "
"train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "
"provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its "
"chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand "

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all "

"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, "
"a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid "
"hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast "
"zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The "
"battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The "
"trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint "

"A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. "
"The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds "
"that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three "
"seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core "
"of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the "
"grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical "
"orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched "
"off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "
"with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-"
"tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into "
"hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is "
"fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of "
"Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually "
"turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "
"another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been "
"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum "
"effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three "
"parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity "
"allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous "
"situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate "
"anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an "
"MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, "
"AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS "
"ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of "
"the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create "
"revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops "
"the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification "
"HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our "
"assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care "
"should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could "
"have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during "
"firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The "
"HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. "
"Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to "
"the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 "
"metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat "
"knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and grenades, this is one of the few standard-issue "
"human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short "
"range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. "
"It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms "
"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in nasty wounds that will "
"either kill the target or send it running for cover.\n"
"\n"
"This short shell -- only 90mm long -- was designed for pistol-configuration "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the "
"most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first "
"prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese "
"government. Production models were only trickling into government units by "
"the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to "
"respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew "
"through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version "
"of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with "
"aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally "
"through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round "
"at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of "
"SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next "
"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "
"the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly "
"50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known "
"design flaw.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification CRC-"
"8.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very "
"well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out "
"to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be "
"too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"
"\n"
"While the CRC-8 does suffer excessive muzzle climb on full auto, throwing "
"off the aim of even experienced users, it is much more docile in its "
"standard burst mode. Full auto should rarely be considered outside of panic "
"situations.\n"

"Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block "

"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. "
"Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like "
"an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium "
"tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. "
"It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract "
"radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. "
"Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM "

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-"
"automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of "
"the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX "
"should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced "
"accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and "
"display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps "
"the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken "
"ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any "
"shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in "
"Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon "
"will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can "
"be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been "
"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "

"\n"
"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks "
"can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, "
"but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. "
"The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any "
"humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical "

"how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a "

"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our "

"plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This "
"particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the "
"plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of "
"accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying "
"tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this "
"technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the "
"ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"The pistol itself is quite simple in build, just a shell covering a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses for focusing and constricting the particle "
"beam. This is all stuff we can duplicate easily with enough money and "
"effort. However, we've yet to figure out the weapon's ammo supply. The "
"energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our "
"efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open "
"it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these "
"magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand "
"them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, "
"with impressive armour-piercing capabilities and extreme damage potential. "
"The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot "
"at ranges of up to 40 metres. Just one shot. With regards to lethality at "
"range, it outperforms even our laser pistol. The only good news is that the "
"PB pistol is significantly less accurate than our lasers and produce too "
"much of a kick to make repeated accurate shots.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the "
"required physical strength. The particles leaving the barrel move at a "
"fraction of the speed of light, so they generate an unholy amount of recoil "

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. "
"Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious "
"about this war.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that "
"can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "

"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version "
"of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. "
"Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact "
"alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we "
"already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are "
"honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery "
"needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best "
"to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the "
"soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close "
"assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and "
"explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary "
"devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric "
"temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no "
"place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he "
"roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "

"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "

"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"

"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens "
"wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or "
"brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still "
"overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "

"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full "
"extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to "
"examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the "
"discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn "
"their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
"communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
"and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
"given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
"there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking "
"EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is "
"another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war "
"with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
"that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
"PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
"extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
"perform up to its design spec."

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn "
"you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before "
"they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before "
"anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble "
"for whatever I say here. Just for the record, the bastarding SecDef can get "
"buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a "
"new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates "
"all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets "
"data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission "
"planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that "
"launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate "
"without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; "
"our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and "
"state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a "
"gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't "
"function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but "
"I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every "
"few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, "
"keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a "
"well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base "
"does get attacked, defending the CC should be a top priority, because "
"without it we will be unable to put up any kind of effective fight until it "
"can be repaired.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"The old CC blueprints have been updated by our engineers to replace the "
"ancient H-9000 mainframe and terminals with up-to-date holo-workstations and "
"a fresh supercomputer installation. All other components are still viable "
"and effective."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"
"absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "
"any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain "
"access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and "
"should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-"
"duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting "
"the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "
"tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains "
"nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to "
"destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick "
"and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over "
"the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "
"equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid "
"deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house "
"and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-"
"injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced "
"facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has "
"available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai "
"hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific "
"bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better "
"prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the "
"coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and "
"contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to "
"completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of "
"Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected "
"to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We "
"are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and "
"regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself "
"through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical "
"nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. "
"Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full "
"health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury "
"counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. "
"Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military "
"sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes "
"and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at "
"the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford "
"the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous "
"electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for "
"treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to "
"be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in "
"a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be "
"obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; "
"convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery "
"must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic "
"upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a "
"negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to "
"kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is "
"relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their "
"primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the "
"Hospital immediately.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"Addendum, Dr. Dolan Connor, 16 March 2084:\n"

"Reviewing the files on PHALANX laboratory facilities, I have concluded that "

"and can be adapted to our use with only minor equipment upgrades."

"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will suitably increase "
"the extent of our radar coverage.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass off civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "
"explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO "
"detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully "
"reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if "
"we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and "
"other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft "
"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "
"authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "
"labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "
"time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and "
"protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in "
"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "
"may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "
"protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility "
"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "
"of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort "
"getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets "
"nearby.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is painfully clear that soldiers during wartime lead highly stressful "
"lives. In order to maintain morale they need a place to unwind and interact "
"in a rank-free environment. We have sought to provide this kind of R&R in "
"the form of the Team Room facility.\n"
"\n"
"It is equipped with a variety of entertainments, from sports tables to high-"
"tech game consoles. It also features a modest wall-mounted cinema display "
"for communal movie screenings. There are vending machines with alcoholic and "
"non-alcoholic beverages, and a separate sitting room for our soldiers to "
"achieve some amount of privacy from the closeness of base living. To this "
"end the sitting room can be locked from the inside for up to 30 minutes per "
"day by each team member. The lock may be overridden from the Control Centre "
"or by a present Command Centre or medical officer in case of an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"All our equipment requires maintenance, and I would argue that our soldiers "
"require the most maintenance of all. The Team Room is one of the best ways "
"to keep them mentally healthy and in fighting trim.\n"
"\n"
"Unless it has access to an operational Power Plant, the Team Room will be "
"shut down to avoid non-vital power consumption.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Team Room is an important tool in maintaining good morale amongst our "
"soldiers and should be built in any base that houses a combat team. It "
"provides them with various vital means of stress relief, which will ease the "
"stressful effects of continued combat, life-threatening situations, and the "
"near-certain death of team members in the field. High morale is essential "
"for our battlefield performance and must be maintained at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"However, I must stress that the Team Room is not a replacement for base "
"leave. Our soldiers will still need to be allowed off-base from time to time "
"in order to maintain their connection with the outside world and their "
"sanity.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of a base attack, the Team Room is an extremely low-risk "
"installation with little to no strategic value. If encountered by "
"extraterrestrial attackers, it will almost certainly be bypassed altogether "
"in favour of more sensitive installations.\n"

"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "

"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"

"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "

"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "

"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to "
"replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of "
"dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
"dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got "
"out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving "
"examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government "
"warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of "
"storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even "
"find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best "
"to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade "
"our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-"
"5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-"
"5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation "
"fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount "
"anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also "
"carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a "
"cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will "
"immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will "
"secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure "
"delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important "
"because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a "
"problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien "
"technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
"generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests "
"with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest "
"piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "
"speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air "
"channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and "
"redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They "
"are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can "
"hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "
"complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at "
"all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire "
"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"
"the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not "
"limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and "
"optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed "
"in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can "
"actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of "
"armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. "
"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
"Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its "
"maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within "
"this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
"recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "

"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
"threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with "
"anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed "
"against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it "
"won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to "
"base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but "
"will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but "
"the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for "
"us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race "

"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
"person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
"little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they "
"held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is probably the "
"most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame "
"and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most "
"modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at "
"speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. "
"However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even better, we've "
"managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right "
"now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit "
"and flight testing, on my authority. This is simply the best knife-fighting "
"aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it.\n"

"\n"
"CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a "
"Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular "
"equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
"and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The "
"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "
"nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to "
"dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the "
"Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that "
"implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain "
"effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. "
"It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
"extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed "
"by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of "
"the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the "
"aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be "
"measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat "
"encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able "
"to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the small UFO we "
"captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward "
"to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to "
"answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the "
"ground. However, now that we've managed to look 'under the hood' and test "
"the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions, we have gained a far "
"clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important "
"discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "
"thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and "
"then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives "
"a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, "
"allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling "
"system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in "
"order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also "
"used to supply the craft's electricity.\n"
"\n"
"- We've found no evidence of landing gear or hover ability in this craft, "
"implying that it isn't meant to land. If it loses both engines, it goes "
"down.\n"
"\n"
"- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when I found out what was in there. The "
"maximum load -- two tenths of a gramme -- could create a blast yield of more "
"than 8 kilotons. By comparison the bomb at Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. "
"Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the "
"fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in "
"an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the "
"containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would "
"be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an "
"extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that antimatter "
"explosions create little to no radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"- The craft is extremely hard to see with our detection equipment. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with infrared and gamma ray detection, as "
"the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"- The slim design (generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air) is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. Every gramme "
"of excess matter has been stripped, and the craft moves fast enough to need "
"very little wing surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part "
"metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, "
"'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact "
"form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more "
"comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's far stronger and tougher "
"than anything we've ever known. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"- We have determined the craft to be unarmed, but it's equipped with what "
"appears to be a large suite of sensors contained in the four protrusions "
"around the cockpit. Curiously, it seems to mount no communications equipment "
"whatsoever, but that would defeat its apparent role as a scout. Your guess "
"is as good as ours, sir.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this class of UFO the 'Scout', as that seems to be its "
"purpose here on Earth. It is used primarily as a reconnaissance unit and "
"vanguard to scout the way for heavier craft. Though unarmed, we should shoot "
"these craft down if we are not otherwise engaged, because anything the "
"aliens are up to is bound to be bad for us.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting "
"expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester "
"UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission "
"somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"Though less manoeuvrable than the Scout craft, it is significantly faster, "
"with a tougher airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to "
"compensate for the increased power of the antimatter engines. It mounts a "
"single weapons system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of "
"high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be "
"able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our "
"combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam "
"of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant "
"range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to "
"render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these "
"intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a "
"gunner and an electronics officer. Like the Scout, the Fighter features no "
"discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What "
"it does have is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the "
"craft even more effective. These systems are very interesting. More research "
"might lead us to great improvements in our own avionics.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis has led us to some new realisations about these smaller classes "
"of UFO. While faster than the Scout, the Fighter is still not very speedy "
"for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien "
"hull materials, the aliens could definitely build far more powerful engines "
"with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel "
"volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are only slightly larger than those in "
"the Scout, and they are very heavily armoured; obviously the aliens aren't "
"taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that "
"a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet "
"mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to get blown up, the "
"amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm any other craft "
"in the formation.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often "
"operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective "
"formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their "
"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "
"than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the "
"Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there "
"is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
"specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
"harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
"and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew "
"has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the "
"UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is "
"they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the "
"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour on the "
"fuel tank, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even in "
"the case of an explosion, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's "
"extremely strong construction. When full the Harvester's fuel tank possesses "
"a potential explosive force of approximately 18 kilotons.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the "
"craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam weapon "
"we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an "
"interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly "
"sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by the same kind of matter-"
"antimatter rockets that drive the UFOs. They are insanely fast, so fast that "
"they don't even need explosive warheads to kill their prey, relying solely "
"on kinetic impact and any remaining antimatter fuel. More research into this "
"weapon will be a high priority.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis of the Harvester's increased capabilities raises the "
"frightening possibility that alien craft will actually grow faster as they "
"become larger and more powerful. There's no doubt that if they can build "
"these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. We should try to "
"adapt the alien antimatter technologies to our own interceptors as soon as "
"possible in preparation and to better deal with the invasion we're facing "
"right now.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, its "
"firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only "
"obvious flaw is a significant drop in manoeuvrability from the Scout and "
"Fighter models. This is one of the few advantages we'll have against the "
"Harvester model; our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have "
"far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on these targets and "
"take them out as fast as possible.\n"

"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "

"\n"
"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, "
"possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of "
"this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be "
"completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be "
"used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting "
"organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous "
"alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, "
"unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever "
"the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
")There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will "
"require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more "
"detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar "
"first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar "
"were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of "
"Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, "
"throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth "
"technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence "
"later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't "
"shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls "
"under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve "
"to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, "
"decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) "
"on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is "
"clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the "
"most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is "
"the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, "
"tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit "
"will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and "
"other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as "
"their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as "
"easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides "
"a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a "
"complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its "
"price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry "
"either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft "
"Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the "
"\"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The "
"expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will "
"certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and "
"significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for "
"quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted "
"in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to "
"make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The "
"installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the "
"Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner "
"can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour "
"once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and "
"unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to "
"wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on "
"this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not "
"recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing "
"because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able "
"to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the "
"duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to "
"be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. "
"However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is "
"used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can "
"provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering "
"his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more "
"interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by "
"sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"This is a pallet of 20mm API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) ammunition for the "
"SHIVA Rotary Cannon. It can contain up to 10,000 rounds.\n"
"\n"
"This high-powered anti-aircraft munition consists of a hard titanium-steel "
"shell, tipped with depleted uranium, and filled with a core of explosive "
"incendiary compound. Once the shell penetrates the outer skin of an "
"aircraft, the core detonates, blowing the shell apart like a fragmentation "
"grenade and spreading incendiary compound over the target area. Critical "
"systems may be damaged before the incendiary compound can be quenched or "
"compartmentalised.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage of the API round over the HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) is "
"its improved penetration, giving each round a better chance of causing some "
"damage if a hit is scored. Penetrating API hits do not cause nearly as much "
"damage as penetrating HEI hits, however.\n"
"\n"
"Each SHIVA cannon is loaded standard with a full pallet of 10,000 rounds, "
"unless there are not enough rounds available in base storage.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It's a tough choice between API and HEI ammo in most situations. If we're "
"expecting to engaging thickly-armoured enemies or have only limited aircraft "
"available to intercept, API is the round of choice. If we're engaging "
"heavily-armed, highly dangerous craft, then massed HEI fire may be one of "
"the quickest ways to take it down.\n"
"\n"
"We can switch out a gun's ammunition in a matter of minutes, but we can't "
"load both types into the same gun. The variable pressure of firing different "
"ammunition can cause misfires and may result in extreme damage to the gun "
"and the aircraft. Both UN safety procedures and the manufacturer's manual "
"absolutely forbid it, and I can't help but agree.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. "
"The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the "
"advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further "
"away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a "
"back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is "
"one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't "
"hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance "
"systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply "
"not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, "
"and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding "
"missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us "
"without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that "
"we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "
"prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary "
"digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of "
"'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted "
"in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer "
"looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and "
"then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has "
"been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater "
"effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've "
"been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready "
"now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it "
"into mass production. This will give us access to 8-missile racks capable of "
"being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at "
"ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded "
"\"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. "
"Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at "
"launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not "
"to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate "
"approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of "
"miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is "
"greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten "
"kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at "
"their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the "
"greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with "
"Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, "

"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 128 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "
"eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket "
"actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can "
"fire all 128 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "
"greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared "
"to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely "
"to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving "
"UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow. In "

"mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster "
"opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single round "
"on the target.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly "
"in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO "
"with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his "
"wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the "
"wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-"
"20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air "
"efficiency.\n"

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly by the UFO's electrical system, "
"constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've "
"rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we "
"can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight "
"electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run "
"it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more "
"research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition "
"will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to "
"reproduce the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the shape will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "

"In the year 2084, Earth is in better shape than it has been for more than a "
"century. Perhaps for the first time, peace and cooperation are the norm "
"rather than the exception. The current state of affairs, however, can only "
"be explained through the brutal history of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of "
"nations around the world. Tensions increased when Iran, Syria, Jordan and "
"Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite "
"the Islamic world. Soon after, democratic elections in Iraq caused the "
"United States to lose control of the country, and Iraq joined the Middle-"
"Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a "
"panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus "
"forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and "
"warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over "
"the years as a result.\n"
"\n"
"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-"
"East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. "
"The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several "
"years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim "
"promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military "
"invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily "
"ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did "
"nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China "
"annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to "
"disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day "
"invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the "
"Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could "
"even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from "
"the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades "
"to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold "
"War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese "
"territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to "
"nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under "
"a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the "
"country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become "
"increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of "
"world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps "
"became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the "
"army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country "
"to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not "
"approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often "
"referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It "
"saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, "
"and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul "
"and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six "
"50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the "
"civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it "
"was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More "
"than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on "
"15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale "
"scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian "
"Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its "
"old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, "
"including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between "
"independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and "
"respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side "
"throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new "
"Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist "
"government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new "
"council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off "
"to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel "
"nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for "
"greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be "
"disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary "
"historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese "
"researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the "
"world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly "
"joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour "
"its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging "
"economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The "
"Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still "
"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Revolutionärsländerna:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Förenade Amerika:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Storeuropeiska gemenskapen:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Mellanösternalliansen:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Nya Afrika:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but "
"it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops "
"are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-"
"old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due "
"to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most "
"of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with "
"one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat "
"poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Ryssland:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "
"state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world "
"superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister "
"Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While "
"the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about "
"who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own "
"problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, "
"which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. "
"Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya "
"could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it "
"did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the "
"Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in "
"Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter "
"conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power "
"plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, "
"safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from "
"enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian "
"plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new "
"type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of "
"the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and "
"from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear "
"revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted "
"element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's "
"waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The "
"Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission "
"became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the "
"world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the "
"example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power "
"generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The "
"nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and "
"commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the "
"country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether "
"under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat "
"antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it "
"does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Samfälligheten Oceanien:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the "
"countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into "
"the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when "
"joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and "
"burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own "
"parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, "
"they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in "
"military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had "
"trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the "
"Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian "
"military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the "
"country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several "
"South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the "
"Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the "
"surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated "
"the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the "
"country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines "
"were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless "
"parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small "
"regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the "
"vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the "
"Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one "
"great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the "
"Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships "
"passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was "
"free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. "
"Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth "
"seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their "
"full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of "
"Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-"
"Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and "
"Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still "
"can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its "
"own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is "
"minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves "
"only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, "
"it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art "
"equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to "
"combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "
"budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some "
"new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the "
"opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but "
"after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into "
"obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its "
"commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their "
"aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk "
"couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's "
"slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the "
"country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in "
"2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was "
"dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown "
"into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered "
"reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The "
"existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter "
"of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The "
"massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them "
"secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on "
"television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of "
"their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap "
"of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things "
"got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, "
"Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it "
"began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session "
"continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with "
"lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien "
"invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. "
"It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in "
"the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, "
"however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one "
"could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the "
"Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as "
"well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned "
"missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that "
"counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital "
"defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear "
"missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish "
"projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one "
"aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, "
"designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an "
"invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it "
"to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part "
"of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, "
"known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the "
"world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a "
"hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to "
"resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was "
"tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were "
"dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the "
"secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support "
"and the men it needed to go to war.\n"
"\n"
"All it lacked was a leader."

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"New information has come to light during the last batch of autopsies you "
"requested. Our reports stand, but we've discovered a commonality that may "
"give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered "
"some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained "
"sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the "
"problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, "
"again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for "
"storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I "
"spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found "
"the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our "
"blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be "
"found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed "
"that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. "
"The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge "
"numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for "
"each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. "
"Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of "
"chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its "
"source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no "
"variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to "
"believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in "
"part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
"infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests "
"on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. "
"The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or "
"positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are "
"essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism "
"requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a "
"parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is far more "
"complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like "
"one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien species carries "
"a unique strand of the infection, we have given them alphabetical "
"designations after the source species in which the strand can be found. "
"Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only "
"thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. "
"We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit "
"each species.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When "
"injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed "
"the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, "
"however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard "
"human T cells. The organism was unable to deactivate our immune system in "
"order to take root.\n"
"\n"
"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers "
"on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated "
"about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our personnel is "
"in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine procedures will be "
"maintained throughout the lab.\n"
"\n"
"Sincerely,\n"
"\n"
"Dr. Connor"
