The projectiles itself do not move with near-lightspeed, but on impact the energy is emitted to the target at a speed that exceeds most physical boundaries known by mankind. This knowledge has been used to create devastating weapons that they now use to terrorize humanity.

msgstr "The AR-80 is the standard weapon of the Phalanx forces. Using improved ammo and a revolutionary design, this rifle can do more damage as any comparable assault rifle. The AR-80s rear loaded clip allows the weapon to fire with greater accuracy as the bullet has to move down an extended muzzle before exiting the weapon. The Assault Rifle can also be repaired much easier due to the fact that it is built in modules. For example, the firing mechanism can be field repaired simply by removing the out of commission back end and inserting a new one. The entire process takes only minutes."

The two sets of jaws are anchored on the creature's enourmous shoulder blades, making them as wide as the creature itself, and provide phenomenal crushing force.The huge wet nose of the beast is in fact its brain, covered with a dense array of sensory cells of varying types. While the ability of the Shevaar to hunt down its prey is heightened by this combined sensory and cognitive organ, its prominent placement and lack of protective bone renders it susceptible to psionic attack, as well as providing an obvious weak point in melee combat."

Mounting points for weaponry are clearly visible, though the markings alongside them have yet to be deciphered and would be our first breakthrough in understanding the alien language.No joints can be seen between the disc and the dozens of fibres that protrude from it, even under an electron microscope. It is possible that the fibres are extruded from the disc itself, which must provide the most efficient distribution of the hovernet's energy and propulsive force.The loose arrangement of the fibres suggests that a successful hit with a projectile or directed energy weapon is unlikely, and blast or incendiary weapons would have greater effect."

It seems that digestive systems and reproductive organs have been removed and replaced by numerous small engines encased within the endoskeleton. Energy created by the chlorophyll in the Ortnok's skin appears to kickstart the reactions in these micro-engines.The purpose of the Antarean cyborg programme is clearly the conversion of the Ortnok into a biomechanical weapons platform that demands much greater energy output and suppression of the reproductive instinct."
