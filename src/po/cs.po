"succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
"achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
"battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to "
"lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical "
"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman "
"to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to "
"those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement "
"by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our "
"custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or "
"radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back "
"into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the "
"system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow "
"damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop "
"functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
"beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
"required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied "
"to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new "
"proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Our collected UN research files have yielded a lot of valuable information "
"about weapons development done on Earth since the beginning of this century. "
"One of the most interesting topics has been the production of DEWs (Directed "
"Energy Weapons), weapons that transfers energy to a target by means other "
"than a projectile. We are particularly interested in the files on Continuous "
"Wave Lasers.\n"
"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers "
"over the years, but no one has ever been able to create a laser that's man-"
"portable and has a power output high enough to compete with ordinary "
"firearms. Now, however, we've been given access to all this combined "

"Our study on antimatter is complete, Commander, and we're ready to present "
"our results. I'm afraid the news is mostly bad.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of things the aliens know that we don't. Nowhere is this "
"more clear in their widespread use of antimatter. It seems to be plentiful "
"for them, at least plentiful enough to send out UFO after UFO to Earth, "
"burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into antimatter, on the "
"other hand . . .\n"
"\n"
"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of "
"anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near "
"Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not long after, another "
"lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come slowly forward over the "
"years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by "
"the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
"availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with "
"every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
"antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
"gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a "
"Scout UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over "
"the past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Another worrying point is that the aliens also seem to be using antimatter "
"as part of their weapons systems. Antimatter-fuelled alien missiles are one "
"thing; what if they begin using antimatter itself as an explosive? My staff "
"has come up with more than one disconcerting idea along these lines. For "
"myself, I think we should try to head the aliens off at the pass in this "
"regard. A special program regarding antimatter-based weapons may be a highly "
"interesting option to pursue -- it may be a more economical prospect than "
"trying to adapt alien rockets to our interceptor craft.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in "
"the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom "
"line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they "
"create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to "
"do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts "
"will be fruitless. Our only major successes have come from studying how the "
"aliens store their antimatter. We are confident we can employ the same "
"magnetic storage techniques, creating special protective pallets that will "
"fit in our Storage facilities without any further adaptations, and we've "
"designed antimatter fuel tanks that will fit in our interceptors, given some "
"major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full understanding of the alien "
"engines before we can begin incorporating it.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If "
"we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering "
"it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may "
"have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we "
"are to have any chance of truly stopping the invasion.\n"

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to "
"our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these "
"mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies "
"seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"In one experiment, an alien specimen was given a box of food, sealed by a "
"two-digit number lock. The subject took six hours to find the right "
"combination by trial and error. This places the alien's IQ well below most "
"large terrestrial mammals; however, when other subjects in the Containment "

"input the right combination on their first attempt without having been "
"exposed to the first specimen's attempts. We know how this looks, Commander, "
"but I assure you my team and I have been thoroughly conscientious about "
"security and separation. The aliens have not been allowed to communicate in "
"any way. We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about "
"these events, though we're working on it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "
"best. Various ways of communication have been attempted without success. "
"Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do "
"not seem to speak or sign in any sense that we understand. Pheromone "
"communication has had no effect beyond simple physical reactions. The large "
"biological disparity between alien species also creates its own share of "
"problems with containment and communication -- please refer to the alien "
"autopsy reports for more details on individual alien physiology.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication "
"with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies "
"confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that "
"we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently "

"\n"
"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, if such experiments were to be approved by the Base Commander, I "
"assure you that my team would take full precautions. Nothing is more "
"important to us than the lives of our men and the security of our "
"facilities.\n"

"\n"
"The live aliens in our Containment unit have begun to display erratic "
"behaviour since the last tactical mission.\n"
"\n"
"Before, the specimens were barely intelligent, operating solely on instinct "
"despite their significantly-developed brain structures. Yet they now seem to "
"be exercising some sort of intelligent control, clearly communicating "
"through the soundproof cells and operating as a team, even going so far as "
"to engineer coordinated escape attempts. Sedative darts were required to "
"subdue the more active specimens.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders "
"of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only "
"thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do "
"what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing "
"from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these "
"points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they "
"go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "
"anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The "
"region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars "
"and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the "
"stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have "
"been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There "
"has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various "
"base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar "
"system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien "
"activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we "
"have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien "
"movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind "
"Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if "
"they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough "
"eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"
"\n"
"This project will take a significant amount of funding and lab-time, "
"Commander, so it requires your authorisation before work can begin.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, "
"the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our "
"arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault "
"weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst "
"mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its "
"tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat "
"experience with it.\n"

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade "
"materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and "
"have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd "
"figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we "
"ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape "
"into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade "
"with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be "
"used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half "
"during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until "
"we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a "
"function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands "
"during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, "
"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "
"they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat "
"knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's "
"sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two "
"weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in "
"lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a "
"sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee "
"combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
"troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of "
"the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a "
"soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses "
"or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the "
"feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to "
"make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, "
"then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, "
"one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten "
"sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The "
"backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special "
"fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, "
"creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a "
"fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts "
"horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees "
"celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it "
"leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding "
"area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly "
"safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"
"\n"
"The ADA 22's main drawbacks are its short range and its complex internals, "
"which are difficult to repair. However, our experienced technicians should "
"have no problem doing maintenance on this model.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this flamethrower the classification CRC-FL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-FL is a close-range weapon; the operator needs to be fast in order "
"to get into weapons range and unleash as much hell as possible. It is also a "
"rather weighty weapon despite its relatively slim design. Strength as well "
"as speed is required to wield it effectively.\n"
"\n"
"Flamethrowers also make great ambush weapons -- just make sure that none of "
"our soldiers are in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"This weapon should not be fired if there are civilians in or near the target "
"zone."

"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "
"until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of "
"effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag "
"grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are "
"placed at risk.\n"
"\n"
"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of "
"available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner "
"might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can "
"significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our "
"troops. Its utility is not to be underestimated.\n"

"\n"
"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was "
"first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or "
"metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th "
"century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made "
"them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: "
"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we've selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the "
"lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 "
"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "
"may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to "
"work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important "
"attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Though quite effective against enemy infantry, frag grenades are weapons of "
"opportunity, not a replacement for firearms or portable artillery. Their "
"range is highly limited and their casualty radius is small. However, if the "
"situation calls for close-range indirect fire or something deadly thrown "
"around a corner, the frag grenade is just the thing.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in "
"the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is "
"strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be "
"equipped with at least one grenade of some variety -- be it a frag grenade, "
"flashbang, incendiary grenade or other -- in case the need should arise. Two "

"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"\n"
"For this project, we already had ready access to all the required "

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it "
"prototyped and ready to go into production at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. "
"In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous "
"wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and "
"far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine "
"have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's "
"very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. "
"It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire "
"or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It "
"can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of "
"continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on "
"hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of "
"material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to "
"be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care "
"will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the "
"path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam "
"will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in "
"permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field "
"officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every "
"turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"Robotic or armoured aliens may be able to survive a beam for some time, even "
"from a heavy laser, before their armour fails. It's recommended to engage "
"these with several soldiers at once and concentrate fire in order to bring "
"them down as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"

"varied arsenal is a healthy arsenal, and can't be easily defended against.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, "
"and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's "
"standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the "
"last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of "
"swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "
"Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
"will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "
"aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection "
"range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up "
"on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching "
"threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
"exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. "
"However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 "
"Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "
"engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man "
"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most "
"of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing "
"them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty "
"inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this "
"penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire "
"consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting "
"available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this "
"message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working "
"on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm "
"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "
"fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste "
"gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down "
"even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the "
"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"
"strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a "
"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate "
"the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or "
"immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything "
"given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus "
"particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy "
"inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use "
"two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "
"which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses "
"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "
"other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't "
"powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the "
"laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy "
"that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for "
"a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to "
"the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without "
"reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"
"\n"
"We will need to have at least one D-F Cartridge on hand at all times in "
"order to be able to load and use a laser pistol.\n"

"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "

"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff "
"into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs "
"between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost "
"certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will "
"appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the "
"control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual "

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon "
"family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster "
"requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of "
"secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great "
"strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-"
"mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh "
"nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt "
"through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
"increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
"bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
"distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the "
"blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and "
"upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. "
"Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, "
"the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme "
"close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which "
"PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found "
"carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone "
"and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun "
"and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is "
"almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most "
"humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and "
"require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the "
"development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's "
"inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is "
"documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to "
"train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "
"provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its "
"chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand "

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all "

"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, "
"a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid "
"hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast "
"zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The "
"battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The "
"trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint "
"scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. "
"A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. "
"The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds "
"that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three "
"seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core "
"of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the "
"grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical "
"orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched "
"off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-"
"velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to "

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-"
"tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into "
"hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is "
"fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of "
"Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually "
"turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "
"another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been "
"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum "
"effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three "
"parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity "
"allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous "
"situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate "
"anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an "
"MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, "
"AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS "
"ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of "
"the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create "
"revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops "
"the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification "
"HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our "
"assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care "
"should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could "
"have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during "
"firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The "
"HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. "
"Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to "
"the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 "
"metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat "
"knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and grenades, this is one of the few standard-issue "
"human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"

"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"The 'Artificial Fog' smoke grenade was developed by the African league of "
"nations during the war on the diamond cartels. It is an ingenious design "
"which proves that, even in the age of electronic perception, the smoke "
"grenade hasn't outlived its usefulness. There is no vision system that "
"cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial "
"Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block "
"the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. "
"Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like "
"an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium "
"tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. "
"It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract "
"radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. "
"Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM "
"spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"
"\n"
"Titanium tetrachloride smoke by itself is slightly harmful to human beings "
"due to its acidity. The additives make it more dangerous, especially "
"breathing iron flakes, but it's nothing our medics can't deal with.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Smoke grenades are an important tool to hide our approaches, cover tactical "
"withdrawals, and to temporarily lock unwanted participants out of a "

"when the opportune moment will present itself.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-"
"automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of "
"the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX "
"should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced "
"accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and "
"display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps "
"the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken "
"ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any "
"shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in "
"Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon "
"will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"

"Along with high-explosive rockets and grenades, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can "
"be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been "
"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "
"protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide "
"airtight coverage of the soldier's body.\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks "
"can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, "
"but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. "
"The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any "
"humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I have an important technical "
"research proposal to make, a proposal to create a new piece of PHALANX "
"equipment for use by our field agents. I realise this falls outside the "
"responsibilities of my division. However, I've already discussed things with "
"Cdr. Navarre, and he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with me on the necessity "
"of the item in question. I had no choice but to go to straight to you with "
"the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical "
"engagements in all the weeks we've been waging this war. Now that we know "
"how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a "
"serious impediment to our biological and chemical research. We need living "

"we don't have the ability to simply clone up some aliens to research. We "
"need prisoners. The sooner the better.\n"
"\n"
"That's why I would like to propose a simple but high-powered electrical "
"shock weapon, not unlike a military stun gun, designed to disable our "
"enemies without killing them. It would be a two-handed man-portable unit "
"with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which "
"should be sufficient even to disable alien robots such as the Bloodspider. "
"We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be "
"disabled long enough for our soldiers to take control of the situation and "
"secure prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our "
"soldiers and \"a throwback to the 20th century\", and refuses to endorse it. "
"He doesn't seem to understand. We have no alternative method of disabling "
"enemies at the voltages required. Commander, we need this weapon as badly as "
"we need live aliens from the field. We can't merely shoot them and hope to "
"patch one or two up again upon return to base. Even if we succeeded in that "

"research and interrogation.\n"

"it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these "
"magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand "
"them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, "

"The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot "

"\n"
"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the "

"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"

"Commander, we've gotten all the info we can from this new alien rifle. It's "
"more bad news, I'm afraid.\n"
"\n"
"We've always suspected that a real alien army would field more than just "
"plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This "
"particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the "
"plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of "
"accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying "
"tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this "
"technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the "
"ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"The rifle seems to follow a very basic, modular design, quite unlike the "
"plasma weapons we've already observed. All the parts can be slotted in or "
"out of the weapon just by pressing an appropriately-located release catch. "
"Strangely, none of the weapon's parts are particularly high-tech or "
"impressive, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money and "
"effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the weapon's ammo "
"supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and "
"despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to "
"safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of "
"these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and "
"understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our "
"infantry armour. The high-energy particles in a particle beam travel so fast "
"that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle armour. "
"When fired at a suit of Combat Armour, the results are gruesome. It "
"penetrates the front of the armour without even slowing down, and still has "
"enough power to punch out the back and continue for several metres before "
"dispersing.\n"
"\n"
"Much heavier protection will be required for our troops to be able to stand "
"up to this kind of fire. In addition to the development of entirely new "
"armours, we should look into upgrading our current suits as soon as "
"possible. We may suffer significant troop losses to alien PB weapons if we "
"don't.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, the rifle's shape is not at all suited to the human body, and even "
"with adaptations it will be poorly balanced for human shooters. If deployed "
"with our squads, our accuracy won't be as good as the aliens.\n"
"\n"

"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that "
"can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "
"production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version "
"of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. "
"Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact "
"alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we "
"already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are "
"honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery "
"needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best "
"to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the "
"soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close "
"assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting "
"realisations. Obviously, the key to creating more effective mobile armour "
"based on the alien suits lies in the direction of nanocomposites. This will "
"require large amounts of carbon nanotubes.\n"
"\n"
"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, "
"and trying to work them into a proper shape was even worse. Because of this "
"nanocomposite armour has never been used except in high-cost vehicles such "
"as aircraft and tanks, and then only in plating that requires minimal "

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and "
"explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary "
"devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric "
"temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no "
"place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he "
"roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, "
"Commander.\n"

"Commander, we've recovered a suit of alien body armour from the battlefield. "
"This armour has been a plague to our soldiers due to its very high "

"surprising that we still haven't managed to cut it open to perform an "
"initial survey of its composition. We should investigate the armour's "
"weaknesses as soon as we can, and perhaps ascertain a way to adapt it for "

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
"mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
"race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy "
"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "
"mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the "
"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens "
"wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or "
"brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still "
"overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "
"critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense "
"nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so "
"many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, "
"as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those "
"upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"Výzkumná zpráva, prověření Sigma -- pouze pro velitele\n"
"\n"
"Zaznamenáno: 16. února 1958\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Přehled\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"V případě setkání s cizáky by měla být Cizácká cela plně využita k ubytování "
"živých a skladování mrtvých mimozemských organismů za účelem jejich "
"intensivního zkoumání. Nejvyšší prioritou je pro nás odhalení cizáckého "
"způsobu myšlení, abychom byli schopni se s nimi dorozumět a pochopit jejich "
"motivaci. Pak možná budeme schopni najít nějaký kompromis, příležitost ke "
"komunikaci, anebo v horším případě alespoň zefektivnit svoji strategii boje "
"proti nim.\n"
"\n"
"V případě útoku na základnu by měla být rychle zvážena okamžitá likvidace "
"všech zajatých cizáků. Nemůžeme si dovolit riskovat jejich osvobození "
"útočníky. Snad jedině v případě věznění nenahraditelných jedinců by bylo "
"možno zvažovat namísto likvidace pouze jejich uspání. Ale to je velmi "
"hazardní strategie a nemusí se vyplatit -- zdůrazňuji, že těžko vyhrajeme "
"jen s polovičatými opatřeními.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Dodatky\n"
"\n"
"Veliteli, který může tuto zprávu v budoucnu číst: Mějte na paměti, že "
"zařízení v cizáckých celách, stejně jako většina ostatního vybavení v "
"projektu PHALANX, má svůj křest ohněm teprve před sebou, doposud nebylo na "
"mimozemských organismech vyzkoušeno. Možná bude nutno jej upravit, aby "
"plnilo svůj účel."

"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates "

"without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; "
"our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"

"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and "
"state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"
"absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "
"any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain "
"access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and "
"should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-"
"duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting "
"the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "
"tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains "
"nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to "
"destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick "
"and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over "
"the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"By: Gen. E. Baxter, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "
"equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid "
"deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house "
"and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "
"could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as "
"tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"\n"
"Náš boj bude zajisté velmi ošklivý, veliteli. Abychom se mohli postarat o "
"těžká zranění z bitev, kterým se naši vojáci nejspíše nevyhnou, potřebujeme "
"špičkové zařízení s vybavením, jaké není dostupné žádné civilní nebo běžné "
"vojenské nemocnici. Je zcela zřejmé, že v Bombaji zemřely stovky lidí zcela "
"zbytečně, jenom protože scházelo vybavení pro ošetření hlubokých plasmových "
"popálenin způsobených cizáckými zbraněmi. Musíme být připraveni lépe.\n"
"\n"
"Původní projekty nemocnic PHALANXu jsou pro nadcházející vřavu zoufale "
"nedostačující. Od svého vzniku v roce 1960 nebyly nikdy modernizovány a "
"nedisponují téměř žádným speciálním zařízením. Museli jsme je tedy zcela "
"nahradit novými, které jsem navrhla s pomocí mjr. Navarra a našich "
"stavebních expertů. Nikdy nepochopím, jak si naši předchůdci představovali, "
"že se vypořádají s bojovými zraněními od neznámé cizácké výzbroje.\n"
"\n"
"Musím říci, že naše zdravotní zařízení jsou nyní nejlepší na světě. Jsme na "
"samé špičce v léčení popálenin, zejména v oblasti nahrazení a regenerace "
"spáleného. Jsme schopni přimět tkáně, aby chybějící části znovu dorostly, a "
"to prostřednictvím intenzivní terapie kombinující dávky speciálních "
"medikamentů, elektrostimulaci nervů a vpravení nanobotů přímo do rány. Čistě "
"teoreticky bychom měli být schopni kteréhokoliv pacienta plně vyléčit během "
"šesti týdnů. A to včetně psychologického vyšetření a případné "
"posttraumatické péče. Lehčí zranění samozřejmě vyléčíme za kratší dobu.\n"
"\n"
"Samozřejmostí je pro nás pokročilá plastická chirurgie a modifikace "
"organismu. Máme přístup k armádním zdrojům z celého světa a můžeme použít "
"výkonné kybernetické končetiny, obrnění trupu, oční implantáty a další "
"pomocná ústrojí. V naší nemocnici není problém takto vylepšit efektivitu "
"vojáků v boji, tedy pokud si budeme moci dovolit postrádat je po dobu "
"rekonvalescence a cenu implantátů.\n"
"\n"
"Nemocnice vyžaduje elektrárnu pro pokrytí své neustále vysoké spotřeby "
"elektřiny.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"Každá základna s vojáky by měla být vybavena nemocnicí. Jestliže nebude k "
"disposici nemocnice PHALANXu, vojáci budou muset být svěřeni normálním "
"nemocnicím, kde se jim nemusí dostat správné péče, což může skončit "
"doživotním zmrzačením nebo i smrtí.\n"
"\n"
"Výhody použití kyberimplantátů jsou zřejmé. Podstoupit proceduru ovšem mohou "
"pouze zdraví jedinci; vojáci v rekonvalescenci, kteří v nedávné době utrpěli "
"zranění nebo byli operováni, se musí nejprve kompletně zotavit, nežli mohou "
"být uznáni za způsobilé k zákroku. Taktéž je nutno pamatovat, že umělá "
"náhrada končetiny nebo oka může mít velmi špatný dopad na celkovou morálku "
"pacienta.\n"
"\n"
"Z taktického hlediska, nemocnice je zařízení se středním rizikem. Cizáci se "
"mohou snažit zabít raněné a připravit nás o vlastní specializované zdravotní "
"zařízení, ale je poměrně nepravděpodobné, že by si vybrali nemocnici jako "
"hlavní cíl. Přesto by měla být nemocnice v případě útoku okamžitě "
"zajištěna.\n"

"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, R&D: Bio & Containment Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Dr. Dolan Connor, 16 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Reviewing the files on PHALANX laboratory facilities, I have concluded that "
"these blueprints were well ahead of their time. The design is still viable "
"and can be adapted to our use with only minor equipment upgrades."

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "
"personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and "
"several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "
"effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of "
"uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/"
"important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage "
"space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate "
"shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural "
"sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "
"designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can "
"take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and "
"supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of "
"tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear "
"blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the "
"event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current "
"tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it "
"the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven "
"minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close "
"-- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they "
"will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to "
"participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most "
"likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant "
"during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is "
"very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can "
"really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will suitably increase "
"the extent of our radar coverage.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass off civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "
"explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO "
"detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully "
"reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if "
"we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and "
"other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft "
"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "
"authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "
"labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "
"time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and "
"protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in "
"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "
"may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "
"protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility "
"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "
"of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort "
"getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets "
"nearby.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is painfully clear that soldiers during wartime lead highly stressful "
"lives. In order to maintain morale they need a place to unwind and interact "
"in a rank-free environment. We have sought to provide this kind of R&R in "
"the form of the Team Room facility.\n"
"\n"
"It is equipped with a variety of entertainments, from sports tables to high-"
"tech game consoles. It also features a modest wall-mounted cinema display "
"for communal movie screenings. There are vending machines with alcoholic and "
"non-alcoholic beverages, and a separate sitting room for our soldiers to "
"achieve some amount of privacy from the closeness of base living. To this "
"end the sitting room can be locked from the inside for up to 30 minutes per "
"day by each team member. The lock may be overridden from the Control Centre "
"or by a present Command Centre or medical officer in case of an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"All our equipment requires maintenance, and I would argue that our soldiers "
"require the most maintenance of all. The Team Room is one of the best ways "
"to keep them mentally healthy and in fighting trim.\n"
"\n"
"Unless it has access to an operational Power Plant, the Team Room will be "
"shut down to avoid non-vital power consumption.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Team Room is an important tool in maintaining good morale amongst our "
"soldiers and should be built in any base that houses a combat team. It "
"provides them with various vital means of stress relief, which will ease the "
"stressful effects of continued combat, life-threatening situations, and the "
"near-certain death of team members in the field. High morale is essential "
"for our battlefield performance and must be maintained at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"However, I must stress that the Team Room is not a replacement for base "
"leave. Our soldiers will still need to be allowed off-base from time to time "
"in order to maintain their connection with the outside world and their "
"sanity.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of a base attack, the Team Room is an extremely low-risk "
"installation with little to no strategic value. If encountered by "
"extraterrestrial attackers, it will almost certainly be bypassed altogether "
"in favour of more sensitive installations.\n"

"\n"
"These are the finished plans for our new UFO storage hangars. They are "
"designed to house one recovered UFO for disassembly, and will be marked as "
"occupied until the craft has been fully broken down into its component parts "
"and the parts transferred to base Storage. UFOs require significant "
"disassembly before they will fit inside Storage, so they must be dismantled "
"before we can begin to store or use the recovered parts. Doing this job on-"
"site is highly inadvisable. It could be hazardous to the health of our "
"scientists and engineers, it might attract looters, and it would without "
"doubt severely compromise the safety and secrecy of our operation.\n"
"\n"
"The importance of studying captured UFOs should be more than obvious. It "
"will give us insight into the workings and vulnerabilities of alien craft, "
"and it may result in the discovery of new techniques to improve our own "
"craft's effectiveness. Once a recovered UFO is secured for transport, it is "
"carried to a PHALANX base by means of transport helicopters. Salvage "
"operations are handled by local UN forces to relieve pressure on our limited "
"resources.\n"
"\n"
"The Small UFO Hangar can store 1 alien craft of limited size. We will assess "
"the size of each UFO type as we encounter them and determine what hangar is "
"required to store them.\n"
"\n"
"The Small UFO Hangar requires a Power Plant to feed its high-power machinery "
"and plasma-based cutting tools. It also requires a Workshop and Storage to "
"handle the dismantling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All salvaged UFOs should be permanently disabled once delivered into our "
"hands. Should the base come under attack from alien forces, we can't afford "
"the extra risk of stored UFOs being reactivated and used against us. Even "
"without a drive unit, any weapon systems left active would present a grave "
"threat to our base.\n"
"\n"
"If this procedure is followed, the UFO Hangar will be of minor tactical "
"importance to alien attackers and will most likely be ignored except as a "
"target of opportunity. Preventing us from dismantling UFOs would be far less "
"attractive than shutting down our research or production, or destroying our "
"base outright.\n"
"\n"
"We will most likely be needing several of these installations to strip and/"
"or examine several UFOs at a time. However, if necessary, we can remove a "
"craft from our hangars and have it destroyed to make room for a new one. In "
"this scenario all parts already transferred to Storage will be available, "

"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX Workshop is a small-scale production line equipped with the most "
"high-tech military manufacturing processes available. It is designed for the "
"production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on "
"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "
"assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the "
"world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines "
"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an "
"operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. "
"The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction "
"efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "
"Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present "
"technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be "
"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "
"base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission "
"objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a "
"victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to "
"destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new "
"aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute "
"necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an "
"extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive "
"posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our "
"faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these "
"nightmare scenarios.\n"

"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to "
"replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of "
"dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
"dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got "
"out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving "
"examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government "
"warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of "
"storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even "
"find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best "
"to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade "
"our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-"
"5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-"
"5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation "
"fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount "
"anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also "
"carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a "
"cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will "
"immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will "
"secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure "
"delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important "
"because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a "
"problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien "
"technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated "
"fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO "
"sighting.\n"

"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
"generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests "
"with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest "
"piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "
"speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air "
"channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and "
"redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They "
"are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can "
"hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "
"complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at "
"all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire "
"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"
"the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not "
"limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and "
"optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed "
"in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can "
"actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of "
"armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. "
"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
"Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its "
"maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within "
"this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
"recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
"described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium wing "
"mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
"threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with "
"anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed "
"against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it "
"won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to "
"base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but "
"will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but "
"the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for "
"us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race "
"is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
"person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
"little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they "
"held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is probably the "
"most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame "
"and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most "
"modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at "
"speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. "
"However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even better, we've "
"managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right "
"now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit "
"and flight testing, on my authority. This is simply the best knife-fighting "
"aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it.\n"

"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a "
"Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular "
"equipment.\n"

"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "

"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the small UFO we "
"captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward "
"to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to "
"answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the "
"ground. However, now that we've managed to look 'under the hood' and test "
"the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions, we have gained a far "
"clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important "
"discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "
"thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and "
"then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives "
"a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, "
"allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling "
"system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in "
"order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also "
"used to supply the craft's electricity.\n"
"\n"
"- We've found no evidence of landing gear or hover ability in this craft, "
"implying that it isn't meant to land. If it loses both engines, it goes "
"down.\n"
"\n"
"- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when I found out what was in there. The "
"maximum load -- two tenths of a gramme -- could create a blast yield of more "
"than 8 kilotons. By comparison the bomb at Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. "
"Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the "
"fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in "
"an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the "
"containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would "
"be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an "
"extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that antimatter "
"explosions create little to no radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"- The craft is extremely hard to see with our detection equipment. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with infrared and gamma ray detection, as "
"the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"- The slim design (generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air) is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. Every gramme "
"of excess matter has been stripped, and the craft moves fast enough to need "
"very little wing surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part "
"metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, "
"'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact "
"form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more "
"comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's far stronger and tougher "
"than anything we've ever known. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"- We have determined the craft to be unarmed, but it's equipped with what "
"appears to be a large suite of sensors contained in the four protrusions "
"around the cockpit. Curiously, it seems to mount no communications equipment "
"whatsoever, but that would defeat its apparent role as a scout. Your guess "
"is as good as ours, sir.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this class of UFO the 'Scout', as that seems to be its "
"purpose here on Earth. It is used primarily as a reconnaissance unit and "
"vanguard to scout the way for heavier craft. Though unarmed, we should shoot "
"these craft down if we are not otherwise engaged, because anything the "
"aliens are up to is bound to be bad for us.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting "
"expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester "
"UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission "
"somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"Though less manoeuvrable than the Scout craft, it is significantly faster, "
"with a tougher airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to "
"compensate for the increased power of the antimatter engines. It mounts a "
"single weapons system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of "
"high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be "
"able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our "
"combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam "
"of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant "
"range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to "
"render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these "
"intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a "
"gunner and an electronics officer. Like the Scout, the Fighter features no "
"discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What "
"it does have is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the "
"craft even more effective. These systems are very interesting. More research "
"might lead us to great improvements in our own avionics.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis has led us to some new realisations about these smaller classes "
"of UFO. While faster than the Scout, the Fighter is still not very speedy "
"for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien "
"hull materials, the aliens could definitely build far more powerful engines "
"with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel "
"volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are only slightly larger than those in "
"the Scout, and they are very heavily armoured; obviously the aliens aren't "
"taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that "
"a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet "
"mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to get blown up, the "
"amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm any other craft "
"in the formation.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often "
"operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective "
"formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their "
"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "
"than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the "
"Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there "
"is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
"specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
"harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
"and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew "
"has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the "
"UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is "
"they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the "
"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour on the "
"fuel tank, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even in "
"the case of an explosion, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's "
"extremely strong construction. When full the Harvester's fuel tank possesses "
"a potential explosive force of approximately 18 kilotons.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the "
"craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam weapon "
"we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an "
"interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly "
"sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by the same kind of matter-"
"antimatter rockets that drive the UFOs. They are insanely fast, so fast that "
"they don't even need explosive warheads to kill their prey, relying solely "
"on kinetic impact and any remaining antimatter fuel. More research into this "
"weapon will be a high priority.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis of the Harvester's increased capabilities raises the "
"frightening possibility that alien craft will actually grow faster as they "
"become larger and more powerful. There's no doubt that if they can build "
"these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. We should try to "
"adapt the alien antimatter technologies to our own interceptors as soon as "
"possible in preparation and to better deal with the invasion we're facing "
"right now.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, its "
"firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only "
"obvious flaw is a significant drop in manoeuvrability from the Scout and "
"Fighter models. This is one of the few advantages we'll have against the "
"Harvester model; our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have "
"far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on these targets and "
"take them out as fast as possible.\n"

"My team has analysed the remains of the arachnid machine our operatives "

"Autopsy reveals that the creature is a complex robot without any organic "
"components. Its body is reminiscent of the terrestrial spider; a central "
"body housing the artificial brain and power cells, and eight legs driven by "
"powerful servomotors that allow it to move across the battlefield at "
"frightening speeds. It is equipped with razor-sharp mandibles which can "

"large cavity located in front of the power cells. These machines have been "
"recorded cutting apart live humans during a terror mission and storing their "
"biomass for retrieval. The process is gruesome and very, very short.\n"
"\n"
"Our soldiers have dubbed the creature 'Bloodspider', and the name has "

"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
"combat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't "
"seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and it "
"seems to have stuck.\n"

"soon as something new develops.\n"

"\n"
"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, "
"possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of "
"this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be "
"completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be "
"used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting "
"organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous "
"alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, "
"unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever "
"the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
")There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will "
"require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more "
"detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar "
"first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar "
"were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of "
"Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, "
"throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth "
"technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence "
"later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't "
"shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls "
"under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve "
"to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, "
"decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) "
"on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is "
"clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the "
"most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is "
"the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, "
"tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit "
"will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and "
"other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as "
"their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as "
"easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides "
"a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a "
"complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its "
"price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry "
"either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft "
"Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the "
"\"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The "
"expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will "
"certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and "
"significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for "
"quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted "
"in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to "
"make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The "
"installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the "
"Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner "
"can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour "
"once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and "
"unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to "
"wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on "
"this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not "
"recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing "
"because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able "
"to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the "
"duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to "
"be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. "
"However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is "
"used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can "
"provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering "
"his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more "
"interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by "
"sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"
"\n"

"Addenda\n"

"None."

"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. "
"The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the "
"advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further "
"away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a "
"back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is "
"one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't "
"hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance "
"systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply "
"not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, "
"and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding "
"missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us "
"without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that "
"we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "
"prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary "
"digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of "
"'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted "
"in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer "
"looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and "
"then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has "
"been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater "
"effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've "
"been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready "
"now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it "
"into mass production. This will give us access to 8-missile racks capable of "
"being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at "
"ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded "
"\"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. "
"Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at "
"launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not "
"to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate "
"approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of "
"miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is "
"greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten "
"kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at "
"their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the "
"greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This is a \"Sparrowhawk\" guided anti-aircraft missile. It is designed to be "
"loaded into the \"Sparrowhawk\" AA Missile Rack.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "
"prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary "
"digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of "
"'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted "
"in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer "
"looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and "
"then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has "
"been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater "
"effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've "
"been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, and it's "
"ready now. We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to "
"put it into mass production.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" is mounted in 8-missile racks, which can then be mounted "
"to the appropriate weapons hardpoints on our aircraft. The missile's range "
"is far superior to any of the other weapons we have available at this time; "
"it's effective out to twelve kilometres from the aircraft thanks to its "
"unique guidance technology. It's also hardened against EMP to prevent it "
"from being disabled electronically.\n"
"\n"
"The individual missiles weigh approximately 65 kilos. A fully-loaded rack is "
"approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. "
"Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at "
"launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not "
"to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate "
"approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of "
"miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is "
"greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten "
"kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at "
"their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the "
"greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with "
"Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, "
"our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this "
"idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 128 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "
"eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket "
"actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can "
"fire all 128 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "
"greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared "
"to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely "
"to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving "
"UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow. In "
"these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, tearing "
"mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster "
"opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single round "
"on the target.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly "
"in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO "
"with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his "
"wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the "
"wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-"
"20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air "
"efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"If the mission target is stationary or ground-based, these rockets will be "
"ideal for softening up any defences and defenders before a tactical "
"mission.\n"

"This is a TR-20 unguided rocket. It is designed to be loaded into the TR-20 "
"Rocket Pod.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket is essentially a very small, very fast plastic dart moulded "
"around a rod of depleted uranium. It is fin-stabilised and powered by a "
"cheap solid-fuel rocket engine, a civilian model which is also popular in "
"amateur rocketry. One of these engines is capable of propelling an amateur "
"rocket eight kilometres into the sky. It's also capable of propelling a "
"heavy DU penetrator into a fighter jet and out the other side.\n"

"\n"
"Due to its weight, the TR-20 rocket has a maximum effective range of 4 "
"kilometres, after which the fuel runs out and the rocket rapidly loses "

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly by the UFO's electrical system, "
"constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've "
"rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we "
"can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight "
"electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run "
"it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more "
"research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition "
"will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"All our aircraft come standard with high-tech targeting systems, but they "

"\n"
"These are all problems that we have no clear solution for at the moment. "
"However, what we can do is mount additional targeting equipment with purpose-"
"built filtering software that our standard systems can't load. This package "
"was specially built by my team using the latest, most accurate data on alien "

"patterns and weaknesses of alien signals, helping to penetrate the wall of "
"Electronic Warfare activity around an alien craft. This will significantly "

"\n"
"The powerful hardware installation involved in this upgrade will take up one "
"complete modular equipment slot on one of our aircraft.\n"

"fire, or it can be used en masse by whole flights of interceptors to bring "
"overwhelming fire to bear on our enemies at all ranges.\n"

"used for defensive electronics or other equipment. This may leave our "
"interceptors weak in other areas.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to "
"reproduce the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the shape will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "

"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"

"Asijská Republika:\n"
"\n"
"V následujících letech se reformovaná Čínská republika vrátila ke svému "
"starému předkomunistickému jménu a pomalu se vzdávala svých dobytých území, "
"včetně těch zabraných v minulých stoletích. Jejich obyvatelům nabídla volbu "
"mezi nezávislostí nebo poslaneckým křeslem v nové vládní radě jako "
"rovnocenná a uznávaná součást nové republiky. Taiwan během celé občanské "
"války bojoval na straně povstalců, po kapitulaci komunistické vlády urovnal "
"své spory s pevninou a byl prvním kdo se připojil k nové republice. Rychle "
"se stal hlavním hráčem v nové radě a pomáhal při vydání zajatých vládních "
"vůdců do Haagu, kde se měli zpovídat z válečných zločinů. Severní Korea, "
"další z povstaleckých států, také zvolila zůstat v Republice cítíc "
"příležitosti pro velký ekonomický růst a svobodu od diktatury. Nikdo z nich "
"nebyl zklamán.\n"
"\n"
"Obnova čínské ekonomiky je současnými historiky považována za zázrak. Čínští "
"výzkumníci udělali první zásadní objevy v nanotechnologii a to přineslo "
"ohromné zdravotnicko-průmyslové zakázky z celého světa. Navzdory staré "
"nenávisti a nedůvěře se ostatní východoasijské národy pomalu připojovaly k "
"Republice, která byla záhy přejmenována na Asijskou Republiku aby byli "
"zohledněni její noví členové. Dokonce i Japonsko se nakonec připojilo aby "
"podpořilo svoji ochabující ekonomiku a zvětšilo počet obyvatel, kterých "
"během války povážlivě ubylo. S čerstvou vzpomínkou na občanskou válku "
"Republika dál prosazovala své zásady. Během let získala solidní pověst za "
"poctivé jednání se všemi svými členy a vybudovala si dostatek důvěry a "
"solidarity k tomu, aby nyní mohla mluvit jedním hlasem za miliardy lidí v "
"jihovýchodní Asii.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je její ekonomika téměř obnovena díky komercializaci nanotechnologie a "
"holografie. Republika stále vlastní silnou a moderní armádu, která je "
"vycvičena lépe než v jakákoliv jiné zemi.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Revoluční země:\n"
"\n"
"S postupným pádem Spojených států a Číny socialismus v Jižní Americe "
"posiloval a během poválečných let slábnul. Smrt americké ekonomiky přinesla "
"vlnu revolučního zápalu, který odklonil několik národů od vlivu kapitalismu. "
"Nicméně díky tomu, že ve většině zemí byl již víceméně zaveden demokratický "
"systém, mohla být vláda lidu poprvé realizována bez korupce a úpadku. Tento "
"nový směr zamýšlel sjednotit principy demokracie se socialistickými ideály.\n"
"\n"
"Během Druhé studené války celý kontinent sledoval hrůzu jaderného útoku na "
"Šanghaj, vysílaný televizí po celé zeměkouli až do poslední vteřiny. Když "
"Čína padla, získal nový směr další významný vítr do svých plachet. Každý "
"totiž mohl na vlastní oči vidět, co se může stát revoluci pokud jde cestou "
"diktatury a totalitářství. Reakce vůdců na sebe nenechala dlouho čekat.\n"
"\n"
"Několik diktátorských států se okamžitě pokusilo zahájit tvrdé represe a "
"předejít povstání dříve než nastane a tím způsobilo prudkou reakci větších "
"demokratických národů, zejména Kuby, Brazílie a Argentiny. Poslední "
"zbývající králové Jižní Ameriky byly najednou opuštěni a bez jakýchkoliv "
"spojenců.\n"
"\n"
"Jeden za druhým podléhali tlaku veřejnosti a politické situaci a byli "
"nahrazováni volenými sněmovnami. Revoluce získávala rychlost místo toho aby "
"ji ztrácela. Její zastánci podporovali větší obchodování, těsnější spojení a "
"případně otevřené hranice dle evropského vzoru. Nová síť dálnic po celém "
"kontinentu posilovala ekonomiky a umožnila mnohem efektivnější použití orné "
"půdy. Přírodní bohatství Jižní Ameriky bylo využito jako nikdy předtím a "
"každý jeho kousek byl přiměřeně oceněn.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes se členské národy semkly tak těsně, že jsou víceméně známy jako jeden "
"celek: Revoluční země. Jedna společná vláda zastupuje celý kontinent a řídí "
"ekonomické impérium, které překonává pouze Rozšířená Evropská Unie. Jejich "
"armáda je malá ale disponuje nejmodernějším vybavením. Výcvik není nijak "
"mimořádný.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Sjednocená Amerika:\n"
"\n"
"Když se ke konci dvacátých let 21. století začala Americká ekonomika "
"hroutit, čím dále tím více lidí opouštělo zemi a vydávalo se za lepším "
"bydlem v Kanadě a paradoxně v Mexiku. Hodnota dolaru se propadla do nevídané "
"hloubky a ožebračila milióny než byla stabilizována Mezinárodním měnovým "
"fondem a mezinárodním společenstvím bank. Poté byl v zemi zaveden drastický "
"reformní plán požadující rozprodání nebo zástavu vice než poloviny veškerého "
"vojenského arzenálu. Byly zmrazeny úrokové sazby a vyváženy technologie a "
"nadbytek zboží aby byl šestnáctibiliónový dluh splacen. Také úspěšné "
"přeorganizování NASA spojené s funkčním prototypem vesmírného letounu "
"přeměnilo kosmický prostor na výnosný podnik. Mys Canaveral začal nabízet "
"nejlevnější vesmírné starty kdekoliv na světě, nejdříve s vlastním "
"prototypem, později se zcela funkčními a zdokonalenými konstrukcemi "
"vesmírných letounů. To výrazně pomohlo obléhané zemi vzít svůj osud zpět do "
"vlastních rukou.\n"
"\n"
"Spolupráce mezi severoamerickými národy začala finanční pomocí z Kanady a "
"Mexika. Ti viděli, že jejich export do USA jde ke dnu a chtěli pomoci "
"stabilizovat svého nejdůležitějšího obchodního partnera. Rostoucí počet "
"emigrantů také vytvářel těsnější vazby. Pak v roce 2042 došlo k naprosto "
"nečekanému politickém obratu když byl v Mexiku zvolen americký emigrant "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia prezidentem.\n"
"\n"
"Volby byly velice sporné, nicméně rozhodnutí ustálo dvě přepočítávání a nový "
"prezident byl uveden do úřadu v červenci 2042. Kombinace rozumných zásad a "
"osobního kouzla nakonec způsobila, že se ke Garciovi přiklonila celá země. A "
"on potom navrhl Zítřejší plán.\n"
"\n"
"V tomto plánu se mělo Mexiko, Kanada a USA spojit do jedné země a opět tak "
"dosáhnout severoamerické supervelmoci. V několika kontroverzních referendech "
"získal Zítřejší plán nadpoloviční většinu ve všech třech státech; 52 % ve "
"Spojených státech, 64 % v Kanadě a 71 % v Mexiku. Spojení bylo nakonec "
"dokončeno v roce 2050 a vznikla Sjednocená Amerika, jedna z nejvlivnějších "
"sil v novém světě. Vzkvétající vesmírný průmysl se rychle rozšířil po celé "
"nové zemi a navzdory několika přehmatům po cestě se Severní Amerika vydala "
"plnou parou k obnově.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je dluh Sjednocené Ameriky z původních šestnácti biliónů pouze dva a "
"životní úroveň se víceméně vrátila tam kde byla před pádem. SA má "
"nejrozvinutější vesmírný průmysl na planetě -- NASA vykonává téměř 70 % "
"komerčních vesmírných startů po celé zeměkouli. Také vyváží obrovské "
"množství zboží do všech ostatních zemí a plánuje návrat k platební "
"schopnosti do méně než tří let. Armáda je nejslabší ze všech supervelmocí. "
"SA má pouze malou armádu dobrovolníků a malý finanční rozpočet na obranu jak "
"je požadováno MMF. Nicméně to nutí SA mít to co má velice dobře vycvičené a "
"pohyblivé, schopné dosáhnout jakéhokoliv místa v zemi během dvou hodin.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rozšířená Evropská Unie:\n"
"\n"
"Každou uplynulou dekádu Evropská Unie pomalu ale jistě dál a dál rozšiřovala "
"své hranice. Nejprve se vydala na Střední východ ve chvíli, kdy v roce 2011 "
"přijala Izrael jako přidruženého člena a poté v roce 2017 povýšila Izrael a "
"Turecko na členy plnohodnotné. Ve stejnou chvíli bylo také přijato několik "
"atlantických ostrovů a jednalo se tak o největší hromadné rozšíření EU v "
"jednadvacátém století.\n"
"\n"
"Po kontroverzním přijetí Izraele jako přidruženého člena v EU následovalo "
"přijetí přísnějších zákonů o lidských právech, svobodě víry a o oddělení "
"církve a státu. Evropská Unie byla také první západní supervelmocí která "
"oficiálně uznala Středovýchodní Koalici a navzdory protestům Spojených států "
"podporovala těsnější vztahy s ní v naději, že dojde ke snížení kulturních "
"konfliktů a pokračující hrozby terorismu. Z větší části uspěla.\n"
"\n"
"Díky přistěhovalectví ze Spojených států v roce 2028 výrazně posílilo "
"Grónsko a formálně deklarovalo svoji nezávislost na Dánsku. Díky tlaku "
"ostatních evropských států dánská vláda neochotně nezávislost uznala a "
"neproběhly tak žádné boje. V následujících měsících Grónsko krátce zvažovalo "
"připojení k USA jako protektorát ale změnilo názor když mu Evropská Unie "
"nabídla plnohodnotné členství. Toto společně s přistoupením několika "
"amerických ostrovních protektorátů v Atlantiku přimělo EU k přejmenování "
"sebe sama na 'Rozšířenou Evropskou Unii'.\n"
"\n"
"Po skončení Druhé studené války byla REU vždy v čele politického vývoje. "
"Byla jedinou západní mocností, která podporovala Středovýchodní Koalici ve "
"vyslovení nedůvěry starým Spojeným Národům za jejich naprosté selhání a "
"neschopnost zasáhnout v případě Čínské rozpínavosti a následné občanské "
"války. REU také silně podporovala úsilí Koalice vybudovat nové Spojené "
"Národy, které by poskytovaly rovnocenné zastoupení všem světovým národům a "
"měly více pravomocí prosazovat principy, pro které byly původně založeny.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Rozšířená Evropská Unie nejsilnější ekonomickou a politickou silou "
"na světě. Nicméně díky její obrovské byrokracii a velkému počtu členů, kteří "
"nemají pokaždé naprosto shodný názor, jsou její manévry pomalé ve všech "
"směrech. Její armáda je velká a silná ale nejednotná, kdy každá členská "
"armáda lpí na jazyce a tradicích své země. Je složité dosáhnout vojenské "
"spolupráce a je třeba při tom přemoci spousty úředních šimlů. Většina vojáků "
"Spojených Národů je pravě z REU, ale ti jsou vždy používáni pouze pro "
"udržování pořádku. V Bruselu se mnoho let vedou vášnivé debaty o tom, jestli "
"armády REU ztratily svou údernou sílu a zdá se, že v dohledu není žádné "
"rozhodnutí.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Středovýchodní Koalice:\n"
"\n"
"Vznik Středovýchodní Koalice byl pro všechny překvapením, včetně lidí, kteří "
"se na něm podíleli. Původní záměr byl pouze oslabit vliv západu na Středním "
"východě. Zakládající a první členové -- Írán, Sýrie, Jordánsko a Afghánistán "
"-- nikdy neplánovali Koalici na déle než jedno desetiletí, předpokládaný čas "
"rozpadu a rozpuštění pod tíhou rozdílů jednotlivých členů.\n"
"\n"
"Všechno změnila Druhá studená válka. Čínská lidová republika už nebyla dále "
"blízkým spojencem proti Západu. Stala se rozpínající se hrozbou a "
"pošilhávala hladovými očky po Nepálu, částech Indie a pravděpodobně i po "
"svrchovaných státech kolem svých západních hranic. Pákistán, Tádžikistán a "
"Kyrgyzstán se hnali do náruče Koalice aby chránili sami sebe před invazí. "
"Arabský poloostrov se připojil ani ne rok poté hledajíc jak zmenšit "
"politický vliv Západu. Aniž by si to uvědomovali, vytvořili tak silný útvar "
"pokrývající téměř celý Střední východ. Jejich pozice byla prostě příliš "
"dobrá aby jim dovolila rozpadnout se.\n"
"\n"
"Rozšířená Koalice byla uznána Evropskou Unií a vstoupila na mezinárodní "
"scénu s trumfy v ruce. Měla pod palcem víceméně všechny zbývající zásoby "
"ropy na světě a měla v úmyslu vytěžit je.\n"
"\n"
"Ekonomická síla Koalice rostla s tím, jak se ztenčovaly zásoby ropy v "
"zahraničí. Výrobci farmaceutik se houfem sbalili a přestěhovali se na "
"Střední východ, do jediného zbývajícího místa na světě, kde je ropa levná a "
"dostupná. To a spousta dalších použití surové ropy umožnilo Střednímu "
"východu přežít Ruskou 'atomovou revoluci' a následný celosvětový přechod k "
"atomové energii. Koalice pokračovala ve svém rozšiřování Egyptem, "
"Uzbekistánem, Turkmenistánem a spornými částmi Afriky okolo Rudého moře. "
"Celá oblast Rudého moře byla rychle uklidněna když Koalice přesunula svou "
"armádu k podpoře nových Afrických členů.\n"
"\n"
"Rozšíření blahobytu odvrátilo dnešní Střední východ od dogmat a nasměrovalo "
"ho k světským zákonům a rovnosti pohlaví. Je stále ovládaný jednotlivci -- "
"sultány, emíry, maliky, prezidenty a generály -- ale jejich pravomoci jsou "
"udržovány pod dohledem zbytku Koalice, vládci kteří nejsou přijati svými "
"kolegy jsou sesazeni. Politická opozice je tolerována díky tlaku z EU a "
"ostatních národů, ale i v roce 2084 má jen pár členských národů Koalice "
"fungující demokracii.\n"
"\n"
"Armáda Koalice je velká, rychlá a zákeřná. Je to jedna z nejelitnějších a "
"výborně vybavených sil na světě. Navíc užívá volnější pravidla boje než "
"Sjednocená Amerika nebo Asijská Republika. Jejich odstavec o 'přijatelných "
"civilních obětech' byl zdrojem obrovského množství kritiky z celého světa, "
"ale Koalice neústupně udržuje v platnosti tento odstavec po čtyři "
"desetiletí.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Nová Afrika:\n"
"\n"
"Zrozena z násilí a hádek, Nová Afrika nalezla svoji jednotnost v odloučení. "
"Po tři desetiletí 21. století postupně slábla, stejně jak to dělala již "
"dlouho před tím se svými občanskými válkami, etnickými čistkami a "
"nepředstavitelnými zvěrstvy. A to až do roku 2039, kdy několik států ze "
"střední Afriky podniklo masívní plán, který měl za úkol vypořádat se s "
"neblaze proslulými diamantovými kartely a vyvlastnit jejich příjmy pro "
"dlouhodobý národní pokrok.\n"
"\n"
"Ten však skončil krvavým vojenským a ekonomickým masakrem. Spojené Národy "
"zkusili různá opatření aby zastavili boje, ale bezzubější než kdykoliv "
"předtím nedosáhli ničeho. Nicméně ke svazu států se nakonec přidalo několik "
"dalších, zhnusených sekýrováním západních korporací a po několika letech "
"urputných bojů porazily kartely jeden po druhém. Tím jim zůstaly některé z "
"největších a nejrozvinutějších diamantových a zlatých dolů na světě; jejich "
"spojené území se tak stalo největším světovým dodavatelem pravých diamantů. "
"Zároveň získaly nový smysl čeho by mohly společně dosáhnout. Zrodilo se "
"jádro Nové Afriky.\n"
"\n"
"Všechny africké státy zapojené do antikartelové války, s výjimkou území "
"věrných Oceánskému Společenství a Středovýchodní Koalici, spolu začali "
"mnohem těsněji spolupracovat berouc si příklad z Jižní Ameriky v budování "
"spolehlivé sítě silnic pro podporu obchodu a komunikace. To zároveň umožnilo "
"mnohem lepší distribuci potravin. Během dalších třiceti let se Nová Afrika "
"úplně zbavila hladomoru uvnitř svých hranic, což ji zcela změnilo v "
"přizpůsobivé etnikum s touhou po nezávislosti uvnitř svých územní a s "
"obrovskými náklady přineslo veřejně dostupnou zdravotnickou péči jejím "
"lidem. Ale také byly v hospodářství objeveny nové možnosti vývozu, "
"udržitelný růst tropických tvrdých dřevin a exotického ovoce. Pravděpodobně "
"poprvé vytvořila tato nová spolupráce cenové smlouvy po celém kontinentu; "
"stejně jako Revoluční země přiměla Nová Afrika okolní svět aby obstojně "
"platil za veškeré zboží a služby.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Nová Afrika ekonomicky stále nejslabší z velmocí, ale rychle roste. "
"Má velkou motivovanou stálou armádu, ale vojáci jsou špatně vybaveni, "
"vyzbrojeni převážně starožitnostmi z bývalých Spojených států a více než "
"století starým sovětským vybavením. Mají také problémy s přesunem na "
"vzdálená místa díky častým poruchám na vybavení a složité geografii "
"kontinentu. Nejlepší možností je pro Nové Afričany partyzánský způsob boje, "
"kdy jsou po celé zemi rozprostřeny malé hlídky a přistání cizáckých plavidel "
"stopují tisíce průzkumníků.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rusko:\n"
"\n"
"Vzpamatování se z pádu Sovětského svazu a obnova sovětským systémem "
"vydrancované státní ekonomiky trvala Rusku několik desetiletí. Hnisalo jako "
"otevřená rána celou první polovinu 21. století, stále se snažilo potlačit "
"neustálá povstání v Čečensku, stále se snažilo reformovat po 70 letech "
"státní nadvlády, stále se snažilo získat zpátky ztracenou pozici světové "
"supervelmoci.\n"
"\n"
"Věci se pro Rusko konečně začaly zlepšovat když v roce 2047 tehdejší "
"předseda vlády Jevgenij Karamazov uznal úplnou nezávislost Čečenska. Zatímco "
"se v nově oficiální Čečenské republice strhla vlna násilí ve sporu kdo by "
"vlastně měl vládnout, Rusko dalo ruce pryč snažíc se vyrovnat s vlastními "
"problémy a ponechalo Čečensko svému osudu a novým vylepšeným Spojeným "
"Národům, které se okamžitě snažily zastavit krveprolití. To se bohužel "
"dlouho nedařilo a nakonec byla pro Čečensko jediná šance vrátit se do sféry "
"ruského vlivu, ale poprvé tak učinilo jako plnohodnotný nezávislý hlas.\n"
"\n"
"Ekonomická záchrana pro Rusko -- zvláště s tenčícími se dodávkami ropy ze "
"Středního východu -- začala novými postupy těžby vlastní ropy na Sibiři s "
"vybavením, které umožňovalo přežití v krutých zimních podmínkách a později "
"pokračovala výstavbou řady nových atomových elektráren. Rusko hodně "
"investovalo do výzkumu aby nové elektrárny byly menší, bezpečnější a hlavně "
"životaschopné. To vyžadovalo přechod z obohaceného uranu na thorium jako "
"hlavního jaderného paliva ve všech těchto elektrárnách a použití nové "
"zdokonalené konstrukce založené na 'energetickém zesilovači', novém typu "
"štěpného reaktoru poprvé testovaného nedaleko Říma v letech 2004 až 2011. "
"Dva z nových reaktorů dokonce zpracovávaly plutonium z demontovaných "
"jaderných zbraní a z uloženého odpadu starších elektráren.\n"
"\n"
"Osm let po Čečenské nezávislosti přišla skutečná Ruská 'atomová revoluce' s "
"vynálezem zpracování vyhořelého paliva, které bylo schopno přeměnit 90 % "
"odpadu z energetického zesilovače na neradioaktivní materiál během týdnů "
"místo několika století. Rusové ukončili letitou energetickou krizi víceméně "
"přes noc; jaderné štěpení se stalo bezpečným, poměrně čistým a celosvětové "
"zásoby thoria mohly zaručit čistotu Země až do roku 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes se mnoho bývalých sovětských států znovu připojilo k Rusku následujíc "
"příkladu ostatních mocností a dychtíc po výhodách, které přináší výroba "
"energie a jaderná technologie, které jsou teď hlavní Ruskou komoditou. "
"Atomová revoluce dokonce dále pokračuje díky pozvolnému rozvoji a "
"komercializaci fúzní energie. Přestože jejich ekonomika má stále problémy, "
"jejich země je na tom lépe než kdykoliv během posledních několika století, "
"ať za vlády chánů, carů nebo sovětů. Jejich armáda je poněkud zastaralá ale "
"profesionální, velice dobře vycvičená s dobrou disciplínou a nepostrádá "
"lidské zdroje.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Oceánské Společenství:\n"
"\n"
"Společenství národů, politická organizace složená převážně ze států starého "
"britského impéria, ztratilo velmi mnoho sil když vstoupilo do Druhé studené "
"války. Nejdříve Pákistán přetrhal vazby se Společenstvím když se připojil ke "
"Středovýchodní Koalici. Když se poté Spojené státy hroutily a kolabovaly, "
"začala se Británie a Kanada víc a víc zajímat jen o své vlastní části světa "
"a nechala svoji spoluúčast zcela vyprchat. V roce 2030 byly členy jen podle "
"jména.\n"
"\n"
"Rostoucí síla Číny během války způsobila obrovský nárůst ve vojenských "
"rozpočtech Indie a Austrálie a to takovým způsobem, že jejich ekonomika měla "
"problém je uspokojit. Poté se v roce 2035 Indie stala jedním velkým bojištěm "
"v Čínské občanské válce. Zkušení vládní válečníci snadno porazili Indickou "
"armádu v několika krátkých ale krvavých bitvách a ukořistili většinu země "
"zatímco je pronásledovali povstalci.\n"
"\n"
"Austrálie společně s několika jihoafrickými členy Společenství slíbila "
"rozsáhlý vojenský zákrok. Po týdnech ukrutných bojů se australským divizím "
"podařilo spojit se s čínskými povstaleckými silami a přeživšími pluky "
"indické armády a společně víceméně vyhladili vládní armádu předtím, než v "
"roce 2036 kapitulovala.\n"
"\n"
"Cena byla vysoká. Z dobyté části Indie byla pustina, po vyhlazení Nového "
"Dillí byla země bez vlády a obyvatelstvo začal sužovat hladomor. Začalo se s "
"předáváním bezcenných částí země ostatním státům a byla dána nezávislost "
"několika malým oblastem kolem hranic. Zbývající státy Společenství se ujaly "
"obrovského úkolu obnovy Indie, přestože mnoho z nich opustilo projekt a "
"Společenství a přidali se k ostatním rostoucím velmocem.\n"
"\n"
"Obnova Indie nakonec sjednotila Společenství v jeden velký národ, který "
"využíval se své geografické polohy kolem Indického oceánu a Jižního Pacifiku "
"a vybíral strategické clo od lodí, které křižovaly jejich vodami. Na druhou "
"stranu byla lodní doprava Společenství bezcelní a rychle se v konkurenčním "
"prostředí stala dominantní. Když byly později rozbity diamantové kartely v "
"Africe, Společenství zkonfiskovalo několik nespravovaných dolů uvnitř svých "
"hranic a zcela jich využilo.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Společenství národů známé spíše jako 'Oceánské Společenství' nebo "
"jenom 'Oceánie'. Od založení do svého středu přijalo několik zemí, které "
"nebyly ve Společenství, hlavně Madagaskar, Zimbabwe a Indonésii, čímž "
"rozšířili svůj vliv na vody Oceánie. Přestože stále nemohou ekonomicky "
"konkurovat bohatším národům, vytvořili si svůj vlastní kout a jsou zcela "
"spokojeni s tím jak se jim daří v něm prosperovat.\n"
"\n"
"Oceánská armáda spočívá hlavně v silném loďstvu. Jejich pozemní armáda je "
"nepatrná a v porovnání s jakoukoliv jinou kromě Sjednocené Ameriky a má "
"pouze obrannou funkci, je průměrně trénovaná a vybavená. Nicméně v krizových "
"situacích může zareagovat poměrně rychle."

"pozorování UFO. Možnost cizácké invaze těžce sužovala mysli politiků "
"vynervovaných jadernou silou Sovětského svazu. Existence nepřátelského "
"mimozemského života ve vesmíru se zdála jako velice nepatrná možnost, "
"dokonce ještě menší než že by tito nepřátelé mohli najít Zemi obklopenou "
"celým širým prostorem -- ale mohla si Amerika dovolit takové riziko?\n"
"\n"
"Zastánci projektu strávili dva roky budováním podpory v nejvyšších vládních "
"kruzích. Konečně, v roce 1957, PHALANX dostal svoji první finanční dotaci. "
"Podstatná část ročního 'černého rozpočtu' padla na výstavbu vyspělého "
"podzemního komplexu v Nevadské poušti kdesi v prostoru letecké základny "
"Nellis. Komplex byl pojmenován \"Velitelství tichomořských operací PHALANX"
"\", vybaven nejmodernějším zařízením a osazen těmi nejlepšími s jasnou vizí "
"jak nejlépe bojovat proti mimozemské invazi na americkou půdu.\n"
"\n"
"Ve svých počátcích byl projekt ohromný úspěch, pod jeho záštitou byly "
"vyvíjeny průkopnické technologie a vyráběny funkční prototypy věcí, které "
"svět nikdy předtím neviděl. A to vše za zlomek nákladů které by měli "
"podnikatelé v civilním sektoru. Díky své skutečné podstatě byl PHALANX "
"předmětem každoročních bitev o finanční rozpočet, ale jeho výzkumné a "
"vývojové úspěchy byly pokaždé důvodem pokračovat dokonce i pro nekompromisní "
"praktiky.\n"
"\n"
"Zatímco PHALANX se stále připravoval na něco, co se nikdy nestalo, svět se "
"bohužel vydal jiným směrem. Válka ve Vietnamu přinesla obrovský nárůst ve "
"vojenských výdajích a jen velice málo bylo přiděleno PHALANXu nebo podobným "
"projektům. Ti viděli své rozpočty seškrtané a spálené tváří v tvář válce. "
"Navzdory opakovaným žádostem o více financí se Generální štáb vzdal "
"exotického programu z roku 1950 jako zbytečného mrhání penězi a nechal ho "
"pokračovat pouze kvůli jeho výzkumným snahám. Většina zbylých financí šla na "
"udržení starého vybavení v provozuschopném stavu. Pokud laboratoře pracovaly "
"tak jen s obtížemi.\n"
"\n"
"Po válce již nebyl PHALANX zcela obnoven a už nikdy nezískal finance které "
"měl v padesátých letech -- roky slávy pominuly. V rámci projektu sice "
"vznikla nějaká nová technologie použitá při Válce v zálivu a díky "
"stoupajícímu rozpočtu Americké armády v prvních letech 21. století nastal "
"krátký návrat na výsluní, ale po těchto záblescích tvořivosti projekt opět "
"upadl v zapomnění.\n"
"\n"
"Druhá studená válka vysála z projektu poslední známky života. Velitelé "
"bojovali o jeho přežití dokonce bez peněz potřebných k udržení "
"provozuschopných letounů, nicméně i vynalezení umělého pavoučího hedvábí je "
"nemohlo zachránit před krachující ekonomikou Spojených států. Státní úpadek "
"do zkázy utáhl opasek všem 'nepodstatným' vojenským programům v zemi, "
"jednomu po druhém. PHALANX byl nakonec stažen z rozpočtu v roce 2027, pět "
"měsíců před jeho 70. výročím. Zaměstnanci byli propuštěni, základna "
"vyklizena, jedinečné vybavení zakonzervováno a uloženo do skladu. Projekt "
"byl rychle zapomenut.\n"
"\n"
"Dokud nebyl znovu objeven 9. března 2084 starým mužem, který se rozpomněl, "
"že o něm četl v zaprášeném archívu ve své dávno zbořené kanceláři.\n"
"\n"
"Hrůza a ohavnost událostí v Bombaji otřásla celým světem. Existence "
"inteligentního cizáckého života ve vesmíru již nebyla věcí víry. Nejenže "
"existoval, ale provedl kontakt tou nejhorší možnou cestou. Krveprolití byla "
"natolik rozsáhlá a očividná, že je vlády na celé Zemi nebyly schopny "
"ututlat. Obraz kouřících zakrvácených ulic ukazovaly televizory na celém "
"světě. Cizáci nenechali žádný jiný důkaz své návštěvy. Než odtáhli tak "
"pečlivě shromáždili své mrtvé a sebrali každý kousek upadlé techniky.\n"
"\n"
"Panika se šířila jako požár bezprostředně za Bombajským vysíláním a věci se "
"ještě zhoršili jak se široká veřejnost dozvěděla o jatkách v Bonnu, "
"Johannesburgu a Bangkoku. Svět věděl, že byl navštíven a nyní si začínal "
"uvědomovat, že byl napaden.\n"
"\n"
"Hledání nějakých řešení bylo zoufalé. Spojené Národy zasedaly nepřetržitě "
"déle než týden. Rychlostí světla byly plány navrhovány a hned zas házeny do "
"koše. Svět byl proti cizácké invazi naprosto bezbranný a to jak vojensky tak "
"psychologicky. Na tohle nebyl nikdo připraven. Byl to jeden ze zapomenutých "
"scénářů o konci světa, které se rozpadaly v prach v zapadlém kumbálu jakési "
"kanceláře pro plánování strategie, nepřečtený a nepovšimnutý. Leč veřejnost "
"požadovala odpovědi které nikdo neznal a činnost kterou nikdo nedokázal "
"zajistit.\n"
"\n"
"Spojené Národy schválily pouze s pár symbolických gest: z rozkazu Rady "
"bezpečnosti NASA evakuovala Mezinárodní vesmírné stanice 1 a 2, stejně jako "
"stálou kolonii na Měsíci. Veškeré plánované mise na Mars byly odloženy na "
"neurčito. Ve všech ostatních důležitých záležitostech byly Spojené Národy v "
"koncích. Některé státy chtěly vybudovat obrovské orbitální opevnění, jiné "
"naléhaly, aby směly zastavit UFO použitím jaderných střel. Ostatní "
"prosazovaly ještě exotičtější projekty. Situace byla den ode dne horší dokud "
"si jeden postarší diplomat nevzpomněl na projekt PHALANX.\n"
"\n"
"S úplným přístupem ke starým americkým záznamům SN s překvapením nalezly "
"plány, návrhy, vybavení a výcvikové příručky -- podrobně propracovanou "
"reakci na obdobnou invazi. Okamžitě se rozhodly obnovit PHALANX a vybavit ho "
"k obraně Země před cizáckou hrozbou. Bohužel všichni kteří někdy byli "
"součástí PHALANXu byli mrtví nebo umírali. Bylo třeba dát dohromady nový "
"personál.\n"
"\n"
"Jednohlasně bylo rozhodnuto uchovat projekt tak tajný jak to jen bude možné, "
"známý pouze nejvyšším světovým politikům a vojenským velitelům. Veřejnost "
"byla uchlácholena krycí legendou a vlídnou lží zatímco vybraný tým agentů z "
"celého světa usiloval o oživení PHALANXu a jeho návrat do vrcholné formy. "
"Bylo vyhledáno a ze zapadlých skladišť zachráněno staré vybavení, oprášeny "
"rozpadající se příručky a uskladněné zbraně znovu sestaveny. S tajnou "
"finanční podporou všech osmi velmocí měl projekt zázemí, podporu a lidi. To "
"vše potřeboval aby mohl vstoupit do války.\n"
"\n"
"Jediné co scházelo byl vůdce."
