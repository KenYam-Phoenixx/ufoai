"Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
"succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
"achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
"battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to "
"lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical "
"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman "
"to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to "
"those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement "
"by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our "
"custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or "
"radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back "
"into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the "
"system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow "
"damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop "
"functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
"beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to "
"our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these "
"mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies "
"seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "

"Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do "

"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication "

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, if such experiments were to be approved by the Base Commander, I "
"assure you that my team would take full precautions. Nothing is more "
"important to us than the lives of our men and the security of our "
"facilities.\n"

"Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "

"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to "

"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate "

"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
"part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
"homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission "
"to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to "
"distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to "
"tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would "
"like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more "
"effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a "
"healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to "
"maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would "

"The increasing intellect of the captive aliens in our Containment unit leads "

"\n"
"(Odd Behaviour)\"There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "

"\"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "

"Dr. Yamamura is beginning to make real progress on this front, teaching the "

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders "
"of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only "
"thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do "
"what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing "
"from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these "
"points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they "
"go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "
"anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The "
"region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars "
"and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the "
"stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have "
"been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There "
"has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various "
"base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar "
"system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien "
"activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we "
"have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien "

"Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if "
"they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough "
"eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have "

"performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are "
"performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police "
"or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the "
"arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and "
"study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take "
"them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby "
"giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% "
"of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or "
"another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million "
"unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to "
"within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be "
"exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have "
"been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien "
"activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress "
"we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder "
"the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment "
"and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of "
"personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped "
"directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"
"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection "
"levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in "
"conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien "
"activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes "
"critical.\n"
"\n"
"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with "
"additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by "
"the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in "
"this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "

"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "
"in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can "
"survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP "
"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "
"trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's "
"ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-"
"sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its "
"size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy "
"assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and "
"light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "
"It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien "
"positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from "
"all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault "
"weapon.\n"
"\n"
"It should be a prime candidate for any soldier with heavy weapons training.\n"

"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-"
"tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into "
"hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is "
"fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of "
"Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually "
"turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "
"another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been "
"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum "
"effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three "
"parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity "
"allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous "
"situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate "
"anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an "
"MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, "
"AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS "
"ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of "
"the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create "
"revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops "
"the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification "
"HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our "
"assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care "
"should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could "
"have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during "
"firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The "
"HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. "
"Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to "
"the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 "
"metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat "
"knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"
"\n"

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, "
"the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our "
"arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault "
"weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst "
"mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its "
"tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat "
"experience with it.\n"

"Commander, we've received a number of research files from several UN nations "

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade "
"materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and "
"have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd "
"figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we "
"ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape "
"into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade "
"with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be "
"used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half "
"during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until "
"we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a "
"function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands "
"during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, "
"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "
"they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat "
"knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's "
"sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two "
"weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in "
"lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a "
"sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee "
"combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"materials used in their construction.\n"
"\n"
"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the "
"alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a "

"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
"troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of "
"the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a "
"soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses "
"or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the "
"feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to "
"make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, "
"then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, "
"one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten "
"sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The "
"backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special "
"fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, "
"creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a "
"fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts "
"horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees "
"celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it "
"leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding "
"area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly "
"safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"
"\n"
"The ADA 22's main drawbacks are its short range and its complex internals, "
"which are difficult to repair. However, our experienced technicians should "

"Flamethrowers also make great ambush weapons -- just make sure that none of "
"our soldiers are in the line of fire.\n"

"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "
"until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of "
"effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag "
"grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are "
"placed at risk.\n"
"\n"
"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of "
"available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner "
"might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can "
"significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our "

"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was "
"first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or "
"metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th "
"century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made "
"them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: "
"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of "
"the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 "
"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "

"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it "

"\n"
"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. "
"In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous "
"wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and "
"far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine "
"have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's "
"very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. "
"It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire "
"or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It "
"can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of "
"continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on "
"hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of "
"material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to "
"be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care "
"will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the "
"path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam "
"will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in "
"permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field "
"officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every "
"turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, "
"and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's "
"standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the "
"last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of "
"swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "
"Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
"will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "
"aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection "
"range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up "
"on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching "
"threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
"exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. "
"However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 "
"Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "
"engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man "
"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most "
"of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing "
"them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty "
"inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this "
"penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire "
"consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting "
"available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"

"on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm "
"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "
"fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste "
"gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down "
"even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the "
"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"
"strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a "
"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate "
"the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or "
"immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything "
"given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus "
"particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy "
"inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use "
"two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "
"which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses "
"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "
"other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't "
"powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the "
"laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy "
"that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for "
"a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to "
"the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without "
"reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"

"We will need to have at least one D-F Cartridge on hand at all times in "

"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff "
"into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs "
"between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost "
"certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will "
"appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the "
"control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual "
"for human use. Our soldiers will now be able to employ the plasma pistol in "
"a combat scenario as they would any other weapon.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon "
"family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster "
"requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of "
"secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great "
"strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-"
"mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh "
"nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt "
"through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
"increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
"bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
"distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the "
"blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and "
"upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. "
"Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, "
"the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme "
"close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which "
"PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found "
"carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone "
"and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun "
"and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is "
"almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most "
"humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and "
"require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the "
"development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's "
"inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is "
"documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to "
"train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "
"provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the "
"news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its "
"chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand "
"has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops "
"while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in "
"danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the "
"target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of "
"things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own "
"lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, "
"sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a "

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all "
"the alien weapons, it's very nasty and very dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, "
"a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid "
"hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast "
"zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The "
"battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The "
"trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint "
"scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. "
"A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. "
"The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds "
"that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three "
"seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core "
"of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the "
"grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical "
"orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched "
"off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-"
"velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to "
"the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast "
"radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be "
"dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard "
"human frag grenade.\n"
"\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short "
"range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. "
"It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms "
"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the "
"most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first "
"prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese "
"government. Production models were only trickling into government units by "
"the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to "
"respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew "
"through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version "
"of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with "
"aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally "
"through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round "
"at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of "
"SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next "
"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "
"the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly "
"50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known "
"design flaw.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification CRC-"
"8.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very "
"well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out "
"to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be "
"too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"
"\n"
"While the CRC-8 does suffer excessive muzzle climb on full auto, throwing "
"off the aim of even experienced users, it is much more docile in its "
"standard burst mode. Full auto should rarely be considered outside of panic "
"situations.\n"

"The 'Artificial Fog' smoke grenade was developed by the African league of "
"nations during the war on the diamond cartels. It is an ingenious design "
"which proves that, even in the age of electronic perception, the smoke "
"grenade hasn't outlived its usefulness. There is no vision system that "
"cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial "
"Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block "
"the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. "
"Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like "
"an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium "
"tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. "
"It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract "
"radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. "
"Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM "
"spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"
"\n"
"Titanium tetrachloride smoke by itself is slightly harmful to human beings "
"due to its acidity. The additives make it more dangerous, especially "

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-"
"automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of "
"the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX "
"should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced "
"accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and "
"display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps "
"the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken "
"ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any "
"shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in "
"Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon "
"will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks "
"can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, "
"but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. "
"The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any "
"humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"

"Operations Command\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that "
"can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "
"production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version "
"of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. "
"Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact "
"alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we "
"already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are "
"honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery "
"needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best "
"to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the "
"soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close "
"assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and "
"explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary "
"devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric "
"temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no "
"place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he "
"roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, "

"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "

"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"

"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens "
"wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or "
"brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still "
"overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "
"critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense "
"nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so "
"many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, "
"as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those "
"upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Souhrn\n"
"\n"
"Prvotním úkolem Jednotky pro boj s mimozemšťany je její příprava na období "
"kdy může být potřeba. Komplex cizáckých cel je důležitou součástí všech "
"plánů reakce na invazi. Obsahuje vzduchotěsné obytné cely, výslechové "
"zařízení, jednotky na distribuci výživy a všechnu ostatní výbavu nutnou k "
"udržení jakéhokoliv mimozemského života kterému bychom mohli porozumět.\n"
"\n"
"Za prvé: Vzduchotěsné obytné cely poskytují prostor k umístění a udržení "
"mimozemšťanů na nezanedbatelně dlouhou dobu. Jejich generátory atmosféry "
"jsou schopny naplnit každou jednotlivou celu jakoukoliv směsí plynů. To může "
"poskytnout mimozemšťanům dýchatelnou atmosféru nejméně na několik týdnů, což "
"dostatečně přesahuje předpokládanou dobu života jedinců v našich výzkumných "
"programech. Může být obtížné získat stopové prvky, které se na Zemi běžně "
"nevyskytují, ale pravděpodobnost že by se to stalo překážkou našeho výzkumu "
"je nekonečně malá. V nejhorším případě jsou generátory atmosféry navrhnuty "
"tak, aby umožňovaly propojení s ukořistěným zařízením pro podporu života.\n"
"\n"
"Za druhé: V každé obytné cele je dálkově řízené lékařské a výslechové "
"zařízení schopné pomocí pneumatické injekční stříkačky aplikovat sedativa, "
"léky nebo jiné chemické injekce, případně pro vyslýchací účely generovat "
"elektrošoky. Zároveň je instalováno tzv. \"havarijní tlačítko\" a to u každé "
"cely nezávisle, případně v řídící místnosti pro každý blok cel. Při "
"mimořádné události lze pomocí havarijního tlačítka obsah cely okamžitě "
"spálit na popel.\n"
"\n"
"Cely a chodby komplexu jsou speciálně navrženy aby umožnily přepravu a "
"držení mimozemšťanů jakýchkoliv tvarů a velikostí. Komplex navíc obsahuje "
"plně vybavenou kryogenní márnici k ukládání mrtvol a vzorků pro pozdější "
"přezkoumání.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"V případě invaze by měl být komplex cizáckých cel plně využit k ubytování "
"živých a skladování mrtvých mimozemšťanů za účelem výzkumu a jejich "
"pozorování v živém stavu. Nejvyšší prioritou je pro nás odhalení způsobu "
"myšlení mimozemšťanů, abychom byli schopni pochopit jejich motivaci a snad "
"najít kompromis, příležitost ke komunikaci, a nebo vhodnou odvetnou "
"strategii k vyhlazení nepřátel jednou pro vždy.\n"
"\n"
"Pokud bude základna PHALANXu napadena, měla by být okamžitě zvážena "
"likvidace všech zajatých cizáků a to i přesto, že to mohou být "
"nenahraditelné exempláře. Nemůžeme riskovat, že útočící mimozemšťané "
"osvobodí své uvězněné druhy. Druhou a nebezpečnější možností je okamžité a "
"úplné uspání sedativy -- nicméně zdůrazňuji, že s polovičatými opatřeními "
"válku nevyhrajeme.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Dodatky\n"
"\n"
"Všem budoucím velitelům, kteří by mohli přezkoumávat tento soubor: Mějte na "
"paměti, že zařízení v komplexu cizáckých cel, stejně jako většina ostatního "
"vybavení PHALANXu, má svůj křest ohněm teprve před sebou a doposud nebylo na "
"mimozemských organismech vyzkoušeno. Možná bude nutno jej upravit nebo "
"zdokonalit tak aby správně plnilo svůj účel."

"\n"
"Filed: 18 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
"countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
"start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
"attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
"aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air "
"Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
"batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. "
"Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-"
"mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in "
"acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a "
"hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
"miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
"study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened "
"is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other "
"incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its "
"target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply "
"need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some "
"old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our "
"results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
"engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This "
"is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an "
"airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless "
"of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on "
"the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but "
"in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics "
"suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the "
"numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has "
"agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no "
"cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage "
"any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack "
"the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting "
"our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of "
"the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to "
"completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage "
"them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or "
"later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
"designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
"longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a "
"follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
"while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
"enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
"effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"None."

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Souhrn\n"
"\n"
"V důsledku nedávného přeorganizování naší letecké flotily jsme museli zcela "
"přehodnotit a znovu navrhnout hangárové vybavení. Požadavek na SVP (Svislý "
"Vzlet a Přistání) u všech nových letounů PHALANXu odstranil potřebu vzletové "
"dráhy. To nám umožnilo přesunout veškeré hangárové vybavení dovnitř základny "
"a zlepšit tak bezpečnost a doby odezvy.\n"
"\n"
"Velký hangár poskytuje podzemní prostor k uložení a údržbě jednoho velkého "
"SVP letounu. Opravy, přezbrojení i natankování mohou být uskutečněny zcela "
"utajeně. Letoun nikdy nevidí denní světlo dokud není čas ke startu. Během "
"něho se střecha hangáru rozvine a letoun je ohromným hydraulickým výtahem "
"vyzdvihnut na místo nad střechou, odkud může bezpečně vzlétnout.\n"
"\n"
"Pro přistávání výtah obsahuje několik dlouhých záchytných háků, které -- "
"jakmile jsou aktivovány podvozkem vznášejícího se pilota -- jemně přitáhnou "
"letoun do přistávací pozice. Záchytné háky umí inteligentně regulovat svůj "
"tah a to dokonce pro každý hák jednotlivě tak aby správně vyrovnaly podvozek "
"pro přistání. Jakmile háky zachytí podvozek a stáhnou ho na přistávací "
"plochu, všechno co musí pilot udělat je vypnutí motorů. Systém je jednoduchý "
"a jakmile si na něj piloti zvyknou i snadno použitelný.\n"
"\n"
"Víceméně shodný systém byl zrealizován i pro malý hangár.\n"
"\n"
"Velký hangár nemůže být použit pro malý letoun z důvodu neslučitelného "
"podpůrného vybavení, např. tankovacího zařízení.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"Hlavní úlohou velkého hangáru je umožnit použití transportérů k rychlému "
"rozmístění jednotek na místa cizácké aktivity. Případně může poskytnout "
"útočiště a podporu většímu bojovému letounu. K posouzení schopností a "
"strategie vyzbrojení jednotlivých letounů prosím nahlédněte do jejich "
"záznamů.\n"
"\n"
"Každý letoun PHALANXu vyžaduje jeden hangár odpovídající velikosti na "
"uložení, údržbu a vyzbrojení.\n"
"\n"
"Hangáry jsou obzvláště zranitelná zařízení díky jejich přímému propojení s "
"povrchem. Budou hlavním vstupním bodem pro všechny mimozemské útočníky. Jsou "
"plné těkavých látek jakou je třeba letecký benzín a pravděpodobně i třaskavé "
"letecké výzbroje což mimořádně zvyšuje nebezpečí poškození. A co je ještě "
"horší, jakýkoliv letoun ponechaný na základně bude velice lákavý cíl; "
"závažné poškození našich stíhaček -- nebo ještě hůře, transportéru -- nás "
"může na týdny vyřadit z boje.\n"
"\n"
"Pokud je to možné, před blížícím se útokem na základnu by měly být všechny "
"letouny skryty a přesunuty mimo oblast dokud útok neskončí. Sice by ve "
"vzduchu mohly být napadeny blížícími se UFO, ale alespoň by měly šanci "
"využít možnosti manévrovat. Avšak toho nemusí být vždy schůdná taktika. "
"Ukrytí našich letounů uvnitř dosahu těžce vyzbrojené útočné lodi může mít "
"mnohem katastrofálnější následky než jejich ponechání ve svých hangárech, "
"jakkoliv lákavý cíl by mohly být.\n"

"Náš boj bude zajisté velmi ošklivý, veliteli. Abychom se mohli postarat o "
"těžká zranění z bitev, kterým se naši vojáci nejspíše nevyhnou, potřebujeme "
"špičkové zařízení s vybavením, jaké není dostupné žádné civilní nebo běžné "

"spáleného. Jsme schopni přimět tkáně, aby chybějící části znovu dorostly, a "
"to prostřednictvím intenzivní terapie kombinující dávky speciálních "
"medikamentů, elektrostimulaci nervů a vpravení nanobotů přímo do rány. Čistě "
"teoreticky bychom měli být schopni kteréhokoliv pacienta plně vyléčit během "

"posttraumatické péče. Lehčí zranění samozřejmě vyléčíme za kratší dobu.\n"

"Každá základna s vojáky by měla být vybavena nemocnicí. Jestliže nebude k "

"doživotním zmrzačením nebo i smrtí.\n"
"\n"
"Výhody použití kyberimplantátů jsou zřejmé. Podstoupit proceduru ovšem mohou "
"pouze zdraví jedinci; vojáci v rekonvalescenci, kteří v nedávné době utrpěli "
"zranění nebo byli operováni, se musí nejprve kompletně zotavit, nežli mohou "
"být uznáni za způsobilé k zákroku. Taktéž je nutno pamatovat, že umělá "
"náhrada končetiny nebo oka může mít velmi špatný dopad na celkovou morálku "
"pacienta.\n"
"\n"
"Z taktického hlediska, nemocnice je zařízení se středním rizikem. Cizáci se "
"mohou snažit zabít raněné a připravit nás o vlastní specializované zdravotní "
"zařízení, ale je poměrně nepravděpodobné, že by si vybrali nemocnici jako "

"\n"
"Souhrn\n"
"\n"
"V důsledku nedávného přeorganizování naší letecké flotily jsme museli zcela "
"přehodnotit a znovu navrhnout hangárové vybavení. Požadavek na SVP (Svislý "
"Vzlet a Přistání) u všech nových letounů PHALANXu odstranil potřebu vzletové "
"dráhy. To nám umožnilo přesunout veškeré hangárové vybavení dovnitř základny "
"a zlepšit tak bezpečnost a doby odezvy.\n"
"\n"
"Malý hangár poskytuje podzemní prostor k uložení a údržbě jednoho malého SVP "
"letounu. Opravy, přezbrojení i natankování mohou být uskutečněny zcela "
"utajeně. Letoun nikdy nevidí denní světlo dokud není čas ke startu. Během "
"něho se střecha hangáru rozvine a letoun je ohromným hydraulickým výtahem "
"vyzdvihnut na místo nad střechou, odkud může bezpečně vzlétnout.\n"
"\n"
"Pro přistávání výtah obsahuje několik dlouhých záchytných háků, které -- "
"jakmile jsou aktivovány podvozkem vznášejícího se pilota -- jemně přitáhnou "
"letoun do přistávací pozice. Záchytné háky umí inteligentně regulovat svůj "
"tah a to dokonce pro každý hák jednotlivě tak aby správně vyrovnaly podvozek "
"pro přistání. Jakmile háky zachytí podvozek a stáhnou ho na přistávací "
"plochu, všechno co musí pilot udělat je vypnutí motorů. Systém je jednoduchý "
"a jakmile si na něj piloti zvyknou i snadno použitelný.\n"
"\n"
"Víceméně shodný systém byl zrealizován i pro velký hangár.\n"
"\n"
"Je zřejmé, že malý hangár nemůže být z důvodu velikosti použit pro velký "
"letoun.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"Hlavní úlohou malého hangáru je umožnit použití stíhaček k pronásledování "
"letících UFO. K posouzení schopností a strategie vyzbrojení jednotlivých "
"letounů prosím nahlédněte do jejich záznamů.\n"
"\n"
"Každý letoun PHALANXu vyžaduje jeden hangár odpovídající velikosti na "
"uložení, údržbu a vyzbrojení.\n"
"\n"
"Hangáry jsou obzvláště zranitelná zařízení díky jejich přímému propojení s "
"povrchem. Budou hlavním vstupním bodem pro všechny mimozemské útočníky. Jsou "
"plné těkavých látek jakou je třeba letecký benzín a pravděpodobně i třaskavé "
"letecké výzbroje což mimořádně zvyšuje nebezpečí poškození. A co je ještě "
"horší, jakýkoliv letoun ponechaný na základně bude velice lákavý cíl; "
"závažné poškození našich stíhaček -- nebo ještě hůře, transportéru -- nás "
"může na týdny vyřadit z boje.\n"
"\n"
"Pokud je to možné, před blížícím se útokem na základnu by měly být všechny "
"letouny skryty a přesunuty mimo oblast dokud útok neskončí. Sice by ve "
"vzduchu mohly být napadeny blížícími se UFO, ale alespoň by měly šanci "
"využít možnosti manévrovat. Avšak toho nemusí být vždy schůdná taktika. "
"Ukrytí našich letounů uvnitř dosahu těžce vyzbrojené útočné lodi může mít "
"mnohem katastrofálnější následky než jejich ponechání ve svých hangárech, "
"jakkoliv lákavý cíl by mohly být.\n"

"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, R&D: Bio & Containment Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Dr. Dolan Connor, 16 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Reviewing the files on PHALANX laboratory facilities, I have concluded that "
"these blueprints were well ahead of their time. The design is still viable "
"and can be adapted to our use with only minor equipment upgrades."

"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"

"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "
"personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and "
"several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "
"effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of "
"uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/"
"important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage "
"space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate "
"shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural "
"sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "
"designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can "
"take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and "
"supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of "
"tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear "
"blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the "
"event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current "
"tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it "
"the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven "
"minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close "
"-- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they "
"will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to "
"participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most "
"likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant "
"during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is "
"very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can "
"really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will suitably increase "
"the extent of our radar coverage.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass off civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "
"explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO "
"detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully "
"reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if "
"we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "

"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "

"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "

"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "

"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "

"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is painfully clear that soldiers during wartime lead highly stressful "
"lives. In order to maintain morale they need a place to unwind and interact "
"in a rank-free environment. We have sought to provide this kind of R&R in "
"the form of the Team Room facility.\n"
"\n"
"It is equipped with a variety of entertainments, from sports tables to high-"
"tech game consoles. It also features a modest wall-mounted cinema display "
"for communal movie screenings. There are vending machines with alcoholic and "
"non-alcoholic beverages, and a separate sitting room for our soldiers to "
"achieve some amount of privacy from the closeness of base living. To this "
"end the sitting room can be locked from the inside for up to 30 minutes per "
"day by each team member. The lock may be overridden from the Control Centre "
"or by a present Command Centre or medical officer in case of an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"All our equipment requires maintenance, and I would argue that our soldiers "
"require the most maintenance of all. The Team Room is one of the best ways "
"to keep them mentally healthy and in fighting trim.\n"
"\n"
"Unless it has access to an operational Power Plant, the Team Room will be "
"shut down to avoid non-vital power consumption.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Team Room is an important tool in maintaining good morale amongst our "
"soldiers and should be built in any base that houses a combat team. It "
"provides them with various vital means of stress relief, which will ease the "
"stressful effects of continued combat, life-threatening situations, and the "
"near-certain death of team members in the field. High morale is essential "
"for our battlefield performance and must be maintained at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"However, I must stress that the Team Room is not a replacement for base "
"leave. Our soldiers will still need to be allowed off-base from time to time "
"in order to maintain their connection with the outside world and their "
"sanity.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of a base attack, the Team Room is an extremely low-risk "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX Workshop is a small-scale production line equipped with the most "
"high-tech military manufacturing processes available. It is designed for the "
"production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on "
"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "
"assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the "
"world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines "
"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an "
"operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. "
"The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction "
"efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "
"Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present "
"technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be "
"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "
"base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission "
"objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a "
"victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to "
"destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new "
"aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute "
"necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an "
"extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive "
"posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our "
"faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these "
"nightmare scenarios.\n"

"DATE: %02i %s %i\n"
"\n"
"SUB: Blueprints -- Antimatter Storage\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but "
"that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the "
"entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter "
"Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN "
"nuclear site register. At full capacity -- 10 grammes of antimatter -- just "
"one storage facility will be containing the equivalent of nearly half a "
"megaton of TNT. While this isn't much compared to modern thermonuclear "
"weapons, it's enough to turn the entire base and everything inside to "
"cinders in less than a second. It's difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but "
"under the wrong circumstances, it can happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the "
"annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the "
"containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at "
"this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed "
"particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be "
"poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"I believe I've already stressed that this facility must be the most heavily-"
"defended building in any PHALANX base, taking priority even over the Command "
"Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would "
"be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap "
"at the Antimatter Storage.\n"
"\n"
"Although this facility will be essential to our continued success in this "
"war, it's going to be very expensive to build and operate due to the "
"advanced tech and materials required. It may be necessary to hold off on "
"building one until we're sure our budget can stretch that far.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, until we manage to build one of these facilities, we'll be "
"completely unable to store or use any recovered antimatter. We can't just "
"build up a pile of unstable, alien, possibly-damaged tanks of nuclear-level "
"explosive. Everything we find will have to be destroyed for safety.\n"
"\n"
"Considering that we can't duplicate the stuff, we're going to need every "
"microgramme we can get our hands on.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"None."

"\n"
"Souhrn\n"
"\n"
"Veliteli, dostal jsem se k těmto starým záznamům dříve než vy a rozhodl jsem "
"se nahradit je mým vlastním výběrem a závěry ohledně naší volby "
"transportéru. Omlouvám se pokud jsem překročil své pravomoci, ale uskladněné "
"staré transportéry PHALANXu zkrátka neodpovídají moderním technologiím. "
"Navíc i v době svého vzniku to byly pouze prototypy. Uplynulých 60 let ve "
"vládních skladech přežily pouze dva exempláře a opravdu nestojí za tu námahu "
"je z nich dolovat. Ve vybavení jsme podědili neskutečný nepořádek. Nemohu "
"najít ani polovinu věcí o kterých se myslelo, že na nás čekají. Dělám co "
"mohu abych nalezl kvalitní náhrady za vybavení, které prostě není schopno "
"plnit své poslání.\n"
"\n"
"Na zmatku ohledně transportéru je pozitivní, že se mi podařilo přesvědčit "
"naše zástupce ve SN k vyčlenění dalších financí na novou loď a myslím, že se "
"vám bude líbit.\n"
"\n"
"Galeoth Firebird SVP (Svislý Vzlet a Přistání) je vynikající letoun, který "
"přesně splňuje naše požadavky na transportér. Původně byl navržen pro "
"nákladní přepravu, ale byl brzy objeven vojenskými dodavateli a přizpůsoben "
"k přepravě jednotek. Stal se oblíbenou alternativou k helikoptérám a to jak "
"ve vojenském tak i civilním sektoru. Největší podíl na tom mají čtyři pulsně-"
"explozivní motory HM-5600, které mu umožňují svislý vzlet a přistání a "
"dosahují dobrého využití paliva s mnohem menším počtem pohybujících se částí "
"než má jakýkoliv helikoptérový motor. To zvyšuje celkovou spolehlivost a "
"společně s absencí lopatek rotoru vede k nesmírně rychlému letounu. Nicméně "
"HM-5600 jsou stále velice žíznivé motory a vysokooktanový letecký benzín "
"může být příliš drahý pro civilní využití.\n"
"\n"
"Cestovní rychlost Firebirdu je 0,74 Machu. Maximální rychlostí 1,03 Machu je "
"schopen jen tak tak překonat rychlost zvuku, ale taková rychlost způsobuje "
"velké namáhání trupu a mělo by se jí užívat pouze v případě nouze. Na přídi "
"má letoun jeden víceúčelový závěsník, který ho umožňuje vyzbrojit "
"protivzdušnými zbraněmi jakými jsou třeba palubní děla nebo nosiče raket. "
"Letoun je také možno vybavit přídavným zařízením a vylepšit tak jeho letové "
"parametry a bojové vlastnosti. Součástí vybavení jsou akcelerační postroje "
"pro osm vojáků a nákladní prostor, který může přepravovat a vypouštět malá "
"bojová vozidla.\n"
"\n"
"V současnosti nelétá nic lépe vybaveného než Firebird co by se nám hodilo "
"jako transportér. Je rychlejší než jakýkoliv vrtulník, má lepší "
"manévrovatelnost než jakékoliv letadlo s pevnými křídly a je schopen rychle "
"a efektivně odpovědět na hrozby po celém světě.\n"
"\n"
"Firebird vyžaduje jeden velký hangár na uložení, údržbu a vyzbrojení. Má "
"jeden střední závěsník zbraní umístěný na přídi.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"Transportér je to co dopraví naše vojáky kolem světa, aby reagovali na "
"cizácké pozemní útoky nebo zajišťovali havarovaná cizácká plavidla pro další "
"využití. Měl by být okamžitě vysílán na místa cizácké aktivity a k zajištění "
"sestřelených cizáckých plavidel.\n"
"\n"
"Jakmile jednotky vyčistí místo od živých cizáků, těžce ranění vojáci budou "
"okamžitě odesláni k ošetření. Ti co zůstanou zabezpečí oblast dokud místo "
"nepřevezme sběrný tým PHALANXu. Ten se postará o převoz všech cizáckých "
"artefaktů do našich zařízení. To je důležité, protože v hustě zalidněných "
"oblastech se mohou stát problémem pokusy o ukořistění věcí zanechaných na "
"bojišti. Nemůžeme si dovolit ztratit cennou cizáckou technologii jenom "
"proto, že si nějaký pitomec usmyslí, že by si měl odnést suvenýr.\n"
"\n"
"I ozbrojený transportér třídy Firebird není schopen čelit specializovaným "
"stíhačkám a nikdy by neměl být posílán v roli stíhacího letounu na jakékoliv "
"zpozorované UFO.\n"

"\n"
"Souhrn\n"
"\n"
"Jsem velice šťastný, že mohu oznámit dokončení prvního výrobního modelu naší "
"stíhačky nové generace a jeho bezproblémové projití všemi letovými "
"zkouškami. Přestože to nejspíš bude znít jako vychloubání, může to být "
"nejlepší kousek lidské technologie, který byl kdy vytvořen.\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto je nepřekonatelná jednomístná stíhačka se schopnostmi SVP (Svislý "
"Vzlet a Přistání), které jí umožňují přistávat na velice malých přistávacích "
"plochách nebo pokud je to nutné uprostřed ničeho. Její ohromná a vysoce "
"účinná turbodmychadla se mohou otáčet o 360 stupňů k dosažení plné "
"manévrovatelnosti a to i při nadzvukových rychlostech. Obrovská sání motoru "
"jsou chráněna důmyslným systémem vzdušných kanálků, které před motorem "
"aktivně čistí vzduch a odvádějí pryč jakýkoliv kousek materiálu, který je "
"dostatečně velký na to aby poškodil lopatky dmychadla. Tato turbodmychadla "
"jsou více než dostatečně silná ke zvednutí vysoce vyzbrojeného trupu a bez "
"podpory ho mohou udržet ve vzduchu až dvě hodiny než spálí veškeré své "
"palivo.\n"
"\n"
"Helikoptérový tvar letounu nemusí vypadat zvláště rychlý, ale zdání někdy "
"klame. Celistvá kostra Stiletta je schopna krátkodobě vydržet cokoliv až do "
"rychlosti dvou Machů. Jeho cestovní rychlost je 1.3 Machu, maximální s "
"přídavným spalováním 2,1 Machu. Tyto vysoké meze staví Stiletto vysoko nad "
"mnoho vojenských tryskových stíhaček, které nejsou schopny dosahovat "
"takových rychlostí.\n"
"\n"
"Jakmile je ve vzduchu, umí poskakovat jako zajíc a v rukách zkušeného pilota "
"je naprosto nelítostný. Je schopen bokem obletět svůj hangárový komplex "
"během šesti sekund zatímco stále udržuje příďový kulomet zaměřený na cíl. "
"Dokáže se zcela přetočit během tří desetin sekundy a zaměřit řízené střely "
"na letoun typu stealth ještě před tím, než je obrátka dokončena.\n"
"\n"
"Řízené střely jsou umístěny v závěsnících přímo pod vnějšími křidélky. "
"Stiletto má také výkonné prostředky elektronického boje s nejmodernější "
"senzorickou soustavu umístěnou v přídi. Ta zahrnuje -- ale není omezena na "
"-- několik zaměřovacích laserů, propracovaný radarový systém a optické "
"zobrazování výkonné tak jako v jakémkoliv špionážním satelitu. Malé EPO "
"emitory umístěné na strategických místech po celém trupu zmatou zaměřovač "
"raket a jsou schopny aktivně rušit příchozí radarové paprsky. Závěsník "
"zbraní může pojmout velký výběr výzbroje a elektronika je kvůli možnosti "
"zdokonalování zcela modulární. Nicméně je třeba pamatovat na to, že v "
"letounu není prostoru nazbyt.\n"
"\n"
"Silné motory Volkot VO-36 spotřebují ohromné množství paliva a nosnost "
"Stiletta není velká. S ponecháním dostatku paliva pro stíhání není jeho "
"maximální účinný dolet větší než 2000 kilometrů. Ale uvnitř tohoto dosahu je "
"tento letoun naprosto nepřekonatelný.\n"
"\n"
"Vezměte prosím na vědomí, že v důsledku svého mimořádného výkonu by neměl "
"být tento letoun používán nezkušenými piloty. Našimi testovacími posádkami "
"bylo jeho ovládání za malých rychlostí popisováno jako 'záludné'.\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto vyžaduje jeden malý hangár na uložení, údržbu a vyzbrojení. Má tři "
"střední závěsníky zbraní, jeden na přídi a dva pod křidélky.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"Stiletto je ideální pro krátkodobé stíhání nepřátelských plavidel "
"ohrožujících základny PHALANXu nebo poblíž civilních cílů. Je schopno "
"postavit se čemukoliv na Zemi a vyhraje. Bohužel nemůže být vysláno proti "
"cílům, které jsou od jeho hangáru vzdáleny více než 2000 km, neboť by nemělo "
"dostatek paliva pro útočné manévry a zpáteční let na základnu. Pro zvětšení "
"bojového dosahu lze uvažovat o doplňování paliva během letu, ale to by "
"vyžadovalo dodatečný vývoj.\n"
"\n"
"Výkonnost proti mimozemskému letounu nemůže být samozřejmě změřena, ale "
"dělali jsme to nejlepší co jsme mohli. Pokud se skutečně dožijeme příchodu "
"cizácké hrozby a Stiletto nebude schopno zastat svou práci, pak bude lidská "
"rasa v maléru.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Dodatky\n"
"\n"
"Dodatek, Velitel Paul Navarre, 18. března 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Veliteli, právě jsem se podíval na tyto lodě třídy Stiletto na papíře i ve "
"skutečnosti a naprosto mě uchvátily. Jen těžko lze uvěřit, že jsme "
"zkonstruovali tyhle věcičky už v šestadvacátém --- a že si nikdo ani "
"nedokázal představit jaký poklad drželi ve svých rukou. Tedy až doteď. To co "
"máme je pravděpodobně nejmanévrovatelnější letoun který byl kdy postaven; "
"naprosto zahanbí útočné helikoptéry a dokáže v kruzích oblétat nejmodernější "
"tryskáče. Dělá zkrátka věci o kterých se moderním letounům může jenom zdát.\n"
"\n"
"Na druhou stranu je noční můrou pilotovat ho díky jeho letové nestabilitě, "
"zejména ve vyšších rychlostech. Původní zpráva vážně podceňuje tuto část "
"technického hodnocení. I přesto mě naši piloti informovali, že budou schopni "
"to zvládnout. A co je ještě lepší, podařilo se nám vysledovat úplný "
"nepoškozený exemplář a právě v dílně probíhá jeho uvedení do provozu. Na mou "
"zodpovědnost jsem vydal pokyn pro úplné vybavení a letové testy. Tohle je "

"většinou ostatních forem aktivního snímání. Jeho trup je víceméně celý "
"složený z uhlíkových vláken a kusů grafitem vyztuženého plastu. To činí "
"letoun neobyčejně pevným a odolným vůči vysokým teplotám, kterých je "
"dosahováno při rychlostech kolem čtyř machů. Saracen je nejrychlejším "
"vojenským letounem v činné službě.\n"
"\n"
"Co se týká schopností, Saracen posouvá náš stíhací dosah do mezinárodních "
"teritorií. Jeho obrovské pancéřované nádrže a úžasně efektivní využití "
"paliva mu umožňují letět nadzvukovou rychlostí kamkoliv až do vzdálenosti "
"deset tisíc kilometrů od jeho hangáru a zpět s dostatečnou zásobou paliva "
"pro bojové manévry. Jeho nezpozorovatelný design, vysoké rychlosti a "
"houževnatý drak mu umožňují zaútočit na UFO, které může být pro stíhačku "
"třídy Stiletto příliš velké sousto. Má také bytelné pancéřování a je schopen "
"se domů vrátit pouze na jeden motor. Může startovat téměř vertikálně díky "
"síle svých motorů a sadě na břiše umístěných přídavných manévrovacích raket, "
"čímž vyhovuje omezení našich hangárů.\n"
"\n"
"Jeho elektronické vybavení je obdobně působivé. Obsahuje nejmodernější "
"zaměřovací počítače, pokročilé radarové a lidarové systémy, zdokonalené "
"prvky EPO (Elektronického ProtiOpatření), VR zobrazení zabudované v helmě "
"pilota a mnohem více. Saracen unese přibližně dvakrát více elektroniky než "
"stíhačka třídy Stiletto a ještě zbyde místo pro další modulární vybavení.\n"
"\n"
"Přes všechny jeho silné stránky je bohužel nákladný na pronájem a údržbu. "
"Navíc se jeho velké zásoby paliva a pancéřování negativně projevují na "
"nosnosti zbraní. Saracen se zbraněmi nemůže vyrovnat mnohem menšímu a "
"levnějšímu Stilettu. Také není možné doufat ve stejnou manévrovatelnost. "
"Navzdory technologii řízení tahu (schopnost změny tvaru motorových trysek k "
"přímému tahu), elektroelastickému povrchu křídel (schopnost dynamické změny "
"tvaru křídel) a dalších fantastických vylepšení je Saracen stále velký "
"letoun s pevnými křídly se všemi omezeními, které z toho vyplývají. Přestože "
"snese mnohem větší poškození než Stiletto a zůstává bojeschopný, Saracen si "
"v boji s cizáckým plavidlem nepovede tak dobře.\n"
"\n"
"Saracen vyžaduje jeden velký hangár na uložení, údržbu a vyzbrojení. Má dva "
"závěsníky zbraní a dva střední nosiče na břiše.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Taktická doporučení\n"
"\n"
"V jádru je Saracen stíhačka na dlouhé vzdálenosti, která by měla být "
"používána proti mimořádně vzdáleným nebo rychlým UFO. Na rozdíl od cizáckých "
"plavidel je jen mírně brzděn pohybem v Zemské atmosféře, čímž je trochu "
"rychlejší než většina UFO, která jsme až dosud pozorovali. To umožní "
"PHALANXu dohonit cizáky kdekoliv kam by mohli jít -- kromě meziplanetárního "
"prostoru.\n"
"\n"
"Výkon Saracenu proti mimozemskému plavidlu nemohl být jako obvykle změřen "
"bez dostatečného množství dat z pozorování alespoň jednoho opravdového "
"bojového střetu. Nicméně pokud bude nasazen v dostatečném množství letů, měl "
"by dokázat zničit cizácké plavidlo jakéhokoliv druhu.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting "
"expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester "
"UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission "
"somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manoeuvrable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly "
"fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side "
"to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter "
"engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This "
"weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough "
"research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, "
"it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely "
"dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of "
"light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or "
"disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these "
"intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a "
"gunner and an electronics officer. The Fighter features no discernible "
"communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have, "
"however, is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft "
"even more effective in air engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us "
"to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster "
"than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a "
"craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull "
"materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The "
"aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current "
"technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "
"armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few "
"tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to "
"be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO "
"does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will "
"not be enough to harm other craft in the same formation. This might not be "
"true for larger craft, however.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often "
"operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective "
"formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their "
"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "
"than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the "
"Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there "
"is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some "
"kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and up to 12 aliens in a "
"small passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has "
"observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material "
"and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' "
"theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo "
"we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship "
"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuvre very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit. This is why a Supply Ship will often be "
"protected by a large screen of Fighter UFOs, in case of interception.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "
"in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our "
"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if we can prevent any Supply Ships from reaching an "
"existing alien strongpoint, we may be able to starve it out for a while "
"before sending in troops. This may give us a crucial tactical advantage.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs "
"we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The "
"long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately "
"apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
"specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
"harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
"and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew "
"has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the "
"UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is "
"they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the "
"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and "
"more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion "
"does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely "
"strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
"possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "
"full.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the "
"craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam weapon "
"we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an "
"interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly "
"sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by matter-antimatter reaction "
"rockets similar to UFO engines. These missiles are insanely fast, so fast "
"that they don't need explosive warheads to kill their prey, relying solely "
"on kinetic impact and the sympathetic detonation of any remaining fuel. More "
"research into this weapon will be a high priority.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, its "
"firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only "
"obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared to smaller UFO types. Our "
"interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more combat "
"experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of the few "
"advantages we'll have over the Harvester, and it would be wise to upgrade "
"our equipment in order to mitigate some of the aliens' tech superiority.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots and craft on any "
"Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then "
"should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some "
"frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as "
"they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can "
"build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without "
"upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous "
"threats in the future.\n"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
"combat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "

"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
"combat.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't "
"seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and it "
"seems to have stuck.\n"
"\n"

"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"\n"
"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, "
"possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of "
"this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be "
"completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be "
"used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting "
"organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous "
"alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, "
"unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever "
"the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "

"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar "
"first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar "
"were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of "
"Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, "
"throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth "
"technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence "
"later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't "

"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls "
"under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve "
"to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, "
"decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) "
"on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is "
"clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the "
"most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is "
"the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, "
"tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit "
"will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and "
"other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as "
"their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as "
"easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides "
"a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a "

"price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry "
"either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft "
"Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the "

"certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and "
"significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for "
"quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted "
"in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to "
"make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The "
"installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the "
"Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner "
"can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour "
"once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and "
"unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to "
"wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on "
"this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not "
"recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing "
"because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able "
"to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the "
"duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to "
"be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

"Commander, I've got some good news. My team and I have finished prototyping "
"the alien aircraft plating project. Our new armour is now ready for full "
"PHALANX production.\n"
"\n"
"This has been a difficult project from the start. We've faced several major "
"challenges in designing equipment capable of bending the alien materials "
"into the shapes we want, and 'programming' the materials to change when we "
"want and how we want them to do so. Ultimately we overcame these problems, "
"but then we had to deal with the natural limitations of the material.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of these alien materials is their weight. They are "
"significantly heftier than modern human aircraft materials, and anything we "
"make from them will suffer from the extra weight. The only way the aliens "
"manage to keep their wingless UFOs in the sky is through overwhelming engine "
"power. Airspeed, manoeuvrability, fuel consumption, maximum operational "
"range -- all these will be negatively affected by putting alien materials "
"onto our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"However, it's a sacrifice we don't seem to have any choice in making. Even a "
"very thin skin of alien materials offers a substantial protective benefit, "
"shrugging off hits that would turn our Polymer Aircraft Armour to paste. "
"During air trials of the new armour, one of our own \"Sparrowhawk\" missiles "
"-- which can bring down most Earth-built aircraft in a single hit -- failed "
"to inflict significant harm to the test craft. I'm not even joking. We've "
"got half an hour of compiled test footage that will confirm everything I "
"just said.\n"
"\n"
"The new aircraft plating we've designed takes full advantage of these "
"capabilities and shows the supreme toughness of the alien materials. The "
"armour can take Particle Beam Weapon hits at point blank range without "
"breaking up. For the very first time, our aircraft will be able to soak up "
"tremendous amounts of damage and still keep flying like the aliens do. I "
"wouldn't say we're quite in the same league yet, but we're getting there.\n"
"\n"
"It may only be feasible to use this armour on aircraft equipped with alien "
"propulsion or otherwise upgraded engines, due to the increased weight and "
"reduced speed and range. Still, even if that turns out to be the case, the "
"new plating will be essential in keeping our current airfleet effective "
"against the mounting alien threat. You and I both know the price tag of new "
"aircraft, Commander -- we cannot afford to let any of our planes become "
"obsolete.\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here "
"is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
"core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
"specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
"course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
"astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of "
"this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
"astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
"system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
"intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', "
"'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters "
"can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you "
"want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when "
"plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do "
"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "
"found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs "
"with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for "
"navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "
"far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of "
"the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon "
"of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as "
"the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system "
"plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information "
"will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of "
"knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into "
"the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but "
"I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared "
"to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with "
"these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we "
"could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we "
"could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will "
"greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point "
"where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click "
"of a button.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. "
"We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally "
"understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO -- Scout)\"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine "
"unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter "
"annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into "
"the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back "
"of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other "
"gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a "
"highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through "
"the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared "
"signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are "
"constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our "
"current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use "
"them for any applications we might come up. I have to warn you, though; they "
"will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien "
"materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling "
"system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and "
"control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just "
"an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to "
"start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in "
"the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these "
"matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start "
"using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious "
"re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a "
"tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the "
"force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. "
"The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human "
"body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have "
"trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to "
"be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and "
"other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may "
"result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust "
"limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during "
"turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and "
"mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done "
"some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for "
"antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining "
"obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes "
"use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses "
"or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, "
"but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics "
"as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old "
"reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the "
"Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in "
"the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now "
"identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in "
"a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity "
"field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and "
"composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial "
"objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there "
"is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to "
"be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we "
"surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range "
"of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which "
"automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be "
"adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps "
"alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or "
"increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire "
"control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence "
"control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based "
"installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and "
"increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs "
"to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech "
"in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat "
"survivability of our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, it's not the immediate uses that are the most important. These "
"detectors are vital for any future PHALANX spacecraft. In space, without the "
"support of ground radar, we're going to need the extra power very badly.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. "
"However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is "
"used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can "
"provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering "
"his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more "
"interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by "
"sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"\n"
"This high-powered anti-aircraft munition consists of a hard titanium-steel "

"grenade and spreading incendiary compound over the target area. Critical "
"systems may be damaged before the incendiary compound can be quenched or "
"compartmentalised.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage of the API round over the HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) is "
"its improved penetration, giving each round a better chance of causing some "

"\n"
"Each SHIVA cannon is loaded standard with a full pallet of 10,000 rounds, "
"unless there are not enough rounds available in base storage.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It's a tough choice between API and HEI ammo in most situations. If we're "
"expecting to engaging thickly-armoured enemies or have only limited aircraft "
"available to intercept, API is the round of choice. If we're engaging "
"heavily-armed, highly dangerous craft, then massed HEI fire may be one of "

"\n"
"We can switch out a gun's ammunition in a matter of minutes, but we can't "
"load both types into the same gun. The variable pressure of firing different "
"ammunition can cause misfires and may result in extreme damage to the gun "
"and the aircraft. Both UN safety procedures and the manufacturer's manual "
"absolutely forbid it, and I can't help but agree.\n"

"This high-powered anti-aircraft munition consists of a hard titanium-steel "
"shell, tipped with depleted uranium, and filled with a core of explosive "
"incendiary compound. Once the shell penetrates the outer skin of an "
"aircraft, the core detonates, blowing the shell apart like a fragmentation "
"grenade and spreading incendiary compound over the target area. Critical "
"systems may be damaged before the incendiary compound can be quenched or "
"compartmentalised. HEI rounds are especially good at this as they pack more "
"incendiary compound and blast it over a far larger area.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage of the HEI round over the API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) is "
"its improved damage potential, giving each round a better chance of "
"disabling or destroying the target if a hit is scored. HEI hits do not "
"penetrate the target's armour as often as API hits, however. If the angle is "
"unfavourable, HEI hits tend to bounce off without causing damage.\n"

"Each SHIVA cannon is loaded standard with a full pallet of 10,000 rounds, "
"unless there are not enough rounds available in base storage.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It's a tough choice between API and HEI ammo in most situations. If we're "
"expecting to engaging thickly-armoured enemies or have only limited aircraft "
"available to intercept, API is the round of choice. If we're engaging "
"heavily-armed, highly dangerous craft, then massed HEI fire may be one of "
"the quickest ways to take it down.\n"
"\n"
"We can switch out a gun's ammunition in a matter of minutes, but we can't "
"load both types into the same gun. The variable pressure of firing different "
"ammunition can cause misfires and may result in extreme damage to the gun "
"and the aircraft. Both UN safety procedures and the manufacturer's manual "
"absolutely forbid it, and I can't help but agree.\n"

"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. "
"The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the "
"advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further "
"away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a "
"back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is "
"one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't "
"hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance "
"systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply "
"not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, "
"and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding "
"missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us "
"without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that "
"we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "
"prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary "
"digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of "
"'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted "
"in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer "
"looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and "
"then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has "
"been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater "
"effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've "
"been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready "
"now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it "
"into mass production. This will give us access to 8-missile racks capable of "
"being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at "
"ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded "
"\"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. "
"Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at "
"launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not "
"to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate "
"approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of "
"miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is "
"greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten "
"kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at "
"their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the "
"greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"

"Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, "
"our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this "
"idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we "

"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 128 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "

"fire all 128 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "

"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly "
"in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO "
"with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his "
"wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the "
"wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-"
"20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air "

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical "
"system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've "
"rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we "
"can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight "
"electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run "
"it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more "
"research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition "
"will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the shape will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "

"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"

"which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we "

"V roce 2048 je Země v lepší formě než tomu bylo po více než století. Asi "
"poprvé jsou mír a spolupráce standardem a nikoliv výjimkou. Nicméně současná "
"situace může být vysvětlena pouze prostřednictvím krutého průběhu 21. "
"století.\n"
"\n"
"V prvním desetiletí 21. století se zájem států celého světa nejvíce "
"soustředil na Střední východ. Napětí se zvýšilo když Írán, Sýrie, Jordánsko "
"a Afghánistán utvořili Středovýchodní Koalici, prvotní politický krok ke "
"sjednocení muslimského světa. Nedlouho poté proběhly demokratické volby v "
"Iráku a to způsobilo, že zde Spojené státy ztratily svůj vliv a Irák se "
"koncem roku připojil ke Středovýchodní Koalici společně s Pákistánem a "
"Libanonem. Izrael v panice vsadil na rozrůstající se Evropskou Unii a přiměl "
"se tak dodržovat stále více se zpřísňující EU zákony o lidských právech a "
"válčení. Následkem toho došlo v průběhu let k výraznému snížení jeho "
"vojenských aktivit v tomto regionu.\n"
"\n"
"Ale jak rok 2009 přecházel do 2010, pozornost se odvracela od Středního "
"východu k vlnobití, které způsobovala Čína se svojí vzrůstající mocí. Lidová "
"Republika několik let dorážela na své sousedy, ale v prosinci 2010, po "
"desetiletích nevrlých slov a zlověstných slibů, byl Taiwan definitivně "
"podroben rozsáhlou invazí Čínské armády. Spojené Národy dali několik "
"strohých pokárání, které byly souhrnně ignorovány. Mezinárodní společenství "
"obšírně probírala tuto událost ale nedělala nic.\n"
"\n"
"Druhá studená válka mezi původními Spojenými státy a Čínou začala když Čína "
"anektovala Severní a Jižní Koreu v roce 2012 poté, co se tajným agentům "
"podařilo vyřadit veškeré jaderné zbraně Jižní Koreje na celou dobu třídenní "
"invaze. Velice dobře vycvičená a vybavená Lidová armáda mnohonásobně "
"přečíslila Korejské divize a obsadila obě země dlouho před tím, než Korejci "
"vůbec mohli začít přijímat pomoc se zámoří. Tento tah vyvolal ještě více "
"zloby od Spojených Národů a ochladil diplomatické vztahy mezi Čínou a Ruskem "
"na několik následujících desetiletí.\n"
"\n"
"Po celou délku Druhé studené války zůstávalo celosvětové napětí vysoké. Na "
"nově podrobených územích denně probíhaly vzpoury, ale nakonec se ani Čína "
"ani USA neodhodlaly vyvolat nukleární zkázu.\n"
"\n"
"Válka víceméně skončila v roce 2031 ve chvíli, kdy se ekonomika USA "
"zhroutila pod ohromným vojenským rozpočtem a deficit dosáhl úrovně "
"překonávající celostátní hrubý národní produkt. Čína se během Studené války "
"stala liberálnější a převzala na sebe roli světového vůdce bez jakékoliv "
"znalosti co si s ní počít. Její vůdci se pravděpodobně opili mocí, příliš "
"lační, příliš domýšliví. Pomocí armády chtěli prosadit svoji vůli a pokusili "
"se obrátit zem do násilného Stalinského útlaku z 20. století. Lid s tím "
"nesouhlasil.\n"
"\n"
"Následovala občanská válka jakou Země ještě nepoznala. Důstojníci ji často "
"přirovnávali ke kříženci války ve Vietnamu a První světové války. Bylo během "
"ní vybombardováno veškeré obyvatelstvo, váleční zajatci byli hromadně "
"popravováni a bylo použito taktických nukleárních úderů na několik měst -- "
"včetně Šanghaje, Soulu a Nového Dillí -- 7. června 2034. Vládní jednotky "
"shodili celkem šest padesátikilotunových bomb na silně bráněné pozice "
"povstalců a zasáhli i civilní populaci, kterou povstalci chránili.\n"
"\n"
"Ve dnech které následovaly vládní armáda utrpěla hromadné dezerce; tato "
"jediná událost konečně přivodila vládě záhubu. Jednotky musely bojovat zuby "
"nehty a operovat roztroušeny na rozlehlém území sežehnuté země zatímco je "
"povstalci pomalu zatlačovali do Indického oceánu. Více než šest miliónů "
"životů bylo ztraceno než vládní síly 15. srpna 2036 kapitulovaly. To byl "
"oficiální konec Druhé studené války."

"Asijská Republika:\n"
"\n"
"V následujících letech se reformovaná Čínská republika vrátila ke svému "
"starému předkomunistickému jménu a pomalu se vzdávala svých dobytých území, "
"včetně těch zabraných v minulých stoletích. Jejich obyvatelům nabídla volbu "
"mezi nezávislostí nebo poslaneckým křeslem v nové vládní radě jako "
"rovnocenná a uznávaná součást nové republiky. Taiwan během celé občanské "
"války bojoval na straně povstalců, po kapitulaci komunistické vlády urovnal "
"své spory s pevninou a byl prvním kdo se připojil k nové republice. Rychle "
"se stal hlavním hráčem v nové radě a pomáhal při vydání zajatých vládních "
"vůdců do Haagu, kde se měli zpovídat z válečných zločinů. Severní Korea, "
"další z povstaleckých států, také zvolila zůstat v Republice cítíc "
"příležitosti pro velký ekonomický růst a svobodu od diktatury. Nikdo z nich "
"nebyl zklamán.\n"
"\n"
"Obnova čínské ekonomiky je současnými historiky považována za zázrak. Čínští "
"výzkumníci udělali první zásadní objevy v nanotechnologii a to přineslo "
"ohromné zdravotnicko-průmyslové zakázky z celého světa. Navzdory staré "
"nenávisti a nedůvěře se ostatní východoasijské národy pomalu připojovaly k "
"Republice, která byla záhy přejmenována na Asijskou Republiku aby byli "
"zohledněni její noví členové. Dokonce i Japonsko se nakonec připojilo aby "
"podpořilo svoji ochabující ekonomiku a zvětšilo počet obyvatel, kterých "
"během války povážlivě ubylo. S čerstvou vzpomínkou na občanskou válku "
"Republika dál prosazovala své zásady. Během let získala solidní pověst za "
"poctivé jednání se všemi svými členy a vybudovala si dostatek důvěry a "
"solidarity k tomu, aby nyní mohla mluvit jedním hlasem za miliardy lidí v "
"jihovýchodní Asii.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je její ekonomika téměř obnovena díky komercializaci nanotechnologie a "
"holografie. Republika stále vlastní silnou a moderní armádu, která je "
"vycvičena lépe než v jakákoliv jiné zemi.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Revoluční země:\n"
"\n"
"S postupným pádem Spojených států a Číny socialismus v Jižní Americe "
"posiloval a během poválečných let slábnul. Smrt americké ekonomiky přinesla "
"vlnu revolučního zápalu, který odklonil několik národů od vlivu kapitalismu. "
"Nicméně díky tomu, že ve většině zemí byl již víceméně zaveden demokratický "
"systém, mohla být vláda lidu poprvé realizována bez korupce a úpadku. Tento "
"nový směr zamýšlel sjednotit principy demokracie se socialistickými ideály.\n"
"\n"
"Během Druhé studené války celý kontinent sledoval hrůzu jaderného útoku na "
"Šanghaj, vysílaný televizí po celé zeměkouli až do poslední vteřiny. Když "
"Čína padla, získal nový směr další významný vítr do svých plachet. Každý "
"totiž mohl na vlastní oči vidět, co se může stát revoluci pokud jde cestou "
"diktatury a totalitářství. Reakce vůdců na sebe nenechala dlouho čekat.\n"
"\n"
"Několik diktátorských států se okamžitě pokusilo zahájit tvrdé represe a "
"předejít povstání dříve než nastane a tím způsobilo prudkou reakci větších "
"demokratických národů, zejména Kuby, Brazílie a Argentiny. Poslední "
"zbývající králové Jižní Ameriky byly najednou opuštěni a bez jakýchkoliv "
"spojenců.\n"
"\n"
"Jeden za druhým podléhali tlaku veřejnosti a politické situaci a byli "
"nahrazováni volenými sněmovnami. Revoluce získávala rychlost místo toho aby "
"ji ztrácela. Její zastánci podporovali větší obchodování, těsnější spojení a "
"případně otevřené hranice dle evropského vzoru. Nová síť dálnic po celém "
"kontinentu posilovala ekonomiky a umožnila mnohem efektivnější použití orné "
"půdy. Přírodní bohatství Jižní Ameriky bylo využito jako nikdy předtím a "
"každý jeho kousek byl přiměřeně oceněn.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes se členské národy semkly tak těsně, že jsou víceméně známy jako jeden "
"celek: Revoluční země. Jedna společná vláda zastupuje celý kontinent a řídí "
"ekonomické impérium, které překonává pouze Rozšířená Evropská Unie. Jejich "
"armáda je malá ale disponuje nejmodernějším vybavením. Výcvik není nijak "
"mimořádný.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Sjednocená Amerika:\n"
"\n"
"Když se ke konci dvacátých let 21. století začala Americká ekonomika "
"hroutit, čím dále tím více lidí opouštělo zemi a vydávalo se za lepším "
"bydlem v Kanadě a paradoxně v Mexiku. Hodnota dolaru se propadla do nevídané "
"hloubky a ožebračila milióny než byla stabilizována Mezinárodním měnovým "
"fondem a mezinárodním společenstvím bank. Poté byl v zemi zaveden drastický "
"reformní plán požadující rozprodání nebo zástavu vice než poloviny veškerého "
"vojenského arzenálu. Byly zmrazeny úrokové sazby a vyváženy technologie a "
"nadbytek zboží aby byl šestnáctibiliónový dluh splacen. Také úspěšné "
"přeorganizování NASA spojené s funkčním prototypem vesmírného letounu "
"přeměnilo kosmický prostor na výnosný podnik. Mys Canaveral začal nabízet "
"nejlevnější vesmírné starty kdekoliv na světě, nejdříve s vlastním "
"prototypem, později se zcela funkčními a zdokonalenými konstrukcemi "
"vesmírných letounů. To výrazně pomohlo obléhané zemi vzít svůj osud zpět do "
"vlastních rukou.\n"
"\n"
"Spolupráce mezi severoamerickými národy začala finanční pomocí z Kanady a "
"Mexika. Ti viděli, že jejich export do USA jde ke dnu a chtěli pomoci "
"stabilizovat svého nejdůležitějšího obchodního partnera. Rostoucí počet "
"emigrantů také vytvářel těsnější vazby. Pak v roce 2042 došlo k naprosto "
"nečekanému politickém obratu když byl v Mexiku zvolen americký emigrant "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia prezidentem.\n"
"\n"
"Volby byly velice sporné, nicméně rozhodnutí ustálo dvě přepočítávání a nový "
"prezident byl uveden do úřadu v červenci 2042. Kombinace rozumných zásad a "
"osobního kouzla nakonec způsobila, že se ke Garciovi přiklonila celá země. A "
"on potom navrhl Zítřejší plán.\n"
"\n"
"V tomto plánu se mělo Mexiko, Kanada a USA spojit do jedné země a opět tak "
"dosáhnout severoamerické supervelmoci. V několika kontroverzních referendech "
"získal Zítřejší plán nadpoloviční většinu ve všech třech státech; 52 % ve "
"Spojených státech, 64 % v Kanadě a 71 % v Mexiku. Spojení bylo nakonec "
"dokončeno v roce 2050 a vznikla Sjednocená Amerika, jedna z nejvlivnějších "
"sil v novém světě. Vzkvétající vesmírný průmysl se rychle rozšířil po celé "
"nové zemi a navzdory několika přehmatům po cestě se Severní Amerika vydala "
"plnou parou k obnově.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je dluh Sjednocené Ameriky z původních šestnácti biliónů pouze dva a "
"životní úroveň se víceméně vrátila tam kde byla před pádem. SA má "
"nejrozvinutější vesmírný průmysl na planetě -- NASA vykonává téměř 70 % "
"komerčních vesmírných startů po celé zeměkouli. Také vyváží obrovské "
"množství zboží do všech ostatních zemí a plánuje návrat k platební "
"schopnosti do méně než tří let. Armáda je nejslabší ze všech supervelmocí. "
"SA má pouze malou armádu dobrovolníků a malý finanční rozpočet na obranu jak "
"je požadováno MMF. Nicméně to nutí SA mít to co má velice dobře vycvičené a "
"pohyblivé, schopné dosáhnout jakéhokoliv místa v zemi během dvou hodin.\n"

"Rozšířená Evropská Unie:\n"
"\n"
"Každou uplynulou dekádu Evropská Unie pomalu ale jistě dál a dál rozšiřovala "
"své hranice. Nejprve se vydala na Střední východ ve chvíli, kdy v roce 2011 "
"přijala Izrael jako přidruženého člena a poté v roce 2017 povýšila Izrael a "
"Turecko na členy plnohodnotné. Ve stejnou chvíli bylo také přijato několik "
"atlantických ostrovů a jednalo se tak o největší hromadné rozšíření EU v "
"jednadvacátém století.\n"
"\n"
"Po kontroverzním přijetí Izraele jako přidruženého člena v EU následovalo "
"přijetí přísnějších zákonů o lidských právech, svobodě víry a o oddělení "
"církve a státu. Evropská Unie byla také první západní supervelmocí která "
"oficiálně uznala Středovýchodní Koalici a navzdory protestům Spojených států "
"podporovala těsnější vztahy s ní v naději, že dojde ke snížení kulturních "
"konfliktů a pokračující hrozby terorismu. Z větší části uspěla.\n"
"\n"
"Díky přistěhovalectví ze Spojených států v roce 2028 výrazně posílilo "
"Grónsko a formálně deklarovalo svoji nezávislost na Dánsku. Díky tlaku "
"ostatních evropských států dánská vláda neochotně nezávislost uznala a "
"neproběhly tak žádné boje. V následujících měsících Grónsko krátce zvažovalo "
"připojení k USA jako protektorát ale změnilo názor když mu Evropská Unie "
"nabídla plnohodnotné členství. Toto společně s přistoupením několika "
"amerických ostrovních protektorátů v Atlantiku přimělo EU k přejmenování "
"sebe sama na 'Rozšířenou Evropskou Unii'.\n"
"\n"
"Po skončení Druhé studené války byla REU vždy v čele politického vývoje. "
"Byla jedinou západní mocností, která podporovala Středovýchodní Koalici ve "
"vyslovení nedůvěry starým Spojeným Národům za jejich naprosté selhání a "
"neschopnost zasáhnout v případě Čínské rozpínavosti a následné občanské "
"války. REU také silně podporovala úsilí Koalice vybudovat nové Spojené "
"Národy, které by poskytovaly rovnocenné zastoupení všem světovým národům a "
"měly více pravomocí prosazovat principy, pro které byly původně založeny.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Rozšířená Evropská Unie nejsilnější ekonomickou a politickou silou "
"na světě. Nicméně díky její obrovské byrokracii a velkému počtu členů, kteří "
"nemají pokaždé naprosto shodný názor, jsou její manévry pomalé ve všech "
"směrech. Její armáda je velká a silná ale nejednotná, kdy každá členská "
"armáda lpí na jazyce a tradicích své země. Je složité dosáhnout vojenské "
"spolupráce a je třeba při tom přemoci spousty úředních šimlů. Většina vojáků "
"Spojených Národů je pravě z REU, ale ti jsou vždy používáni pouze pro "
"udržování pořádku. V Bruselu se mnoho let vedou vášnivé debaty o tom, jestli "
"armády REU ztratily svou údernou sílu a zdá se, že v dohledu není žádné "
"rozhodnutí.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Středovýchodní Koalice:\n"
"\n"
"Vznik Středovýchodní Koalice byl pro všechny překvapením, včetně lidí, kteří "
"se na něm podíleli. Původní záměr byl pouze oslabit vliv západu na Středním "
"východě. Zakládající a první členové -- Írán, Sýrie, Jordánsko a Afghánistán "
"-- nikdy neplánovali Koalici na déle než jedno desetiletí, předpokládaný čas "
"rozpadu a rozpuštění pod tíhou rozdílů jednotlivých členů.\n"
"\n"
"Všechno změnila Druhá studená válka. Čínská lidová republika už nebyla dále "
"blízkým spojencem proti Západu. Stala se rozpínající se hrozbou a "
"pošilhávala hladovými očky po Nepálu, částech Indie a pravděpodobně i po "
"svrchovaných státech kolem svých západních hranic. Pákistán, Tádžikistán a "
"Kyrgyzstán se hnali do náruče Koalice aby chránili sami sebe před invazí. "
"Arabský poloostrov se připojil ani ne rok poté hledajíc jak zmenšit "
"politický vliv Západu. Aniž by si to uvědomovali, vytvořili tak silný útvar "
"pokrývající téměř celý Střední východ. Jejich pozice byla prostě příliš "
"dobrá aby jim dovolila rozpadnout se.\n"
"\n"
"Rozšířená Koalice byla uznána Evropskou Unií a vstoupila na mezinárodní "
"scénu s trumfy v ruce. Měla pod palcem víceméně všechny zbývající zásoby "
"ropy na světě a měla v úmyslu vytěžit je.\n"
"\n"
"Ekonomická síla Koalice rostla s tím, jak se ztenčovaly zásoby ropy v "
"zahraničí. Výrobci farmaceutik se houfem sbalili a přestěhovali se na "
"Střední východ, do jediného zbývajícího místa na světě, kde je ropa levná a "
"dostupná. To a spousta dalších použití surové ropy umožnilo Střednímu "
"východu přežít Ruskou 'atomovou revoluci' a následný celosvětový přechod k "
"atomové energii. Koalice pokračovala ve svém rozšiřování Egyptem, "
"Uzbekistánem, Turkmenistánem a spornými částmi Afriky okolo Rudého moře. "
"Celá oblast Rudého moře byla rychle uklidněna když Koalice přesunula svou "
"armádu k podpoře nových Afrických členů.\n"
"\n"
"Rozšíření blahobytu odvrátilo dnešní Střední východ od dogmat a nasměrovalo "
"ho k světským zákonům a rovnosti pohlaví. Je stále ovládaný jednotlivci -- "
"sultány, emíry, maliky, prezidenty a generály -- ale jejich pravomoci jsou "
"udržovány pod dohledem zbytku Koalice, vládci kteří nejsou přijati svými "
"kolegy jsou sesazeni. Politická opozice je tolerována díky tlaku z EU a "
"ostatních národů, ale i v roce 2084 má jen pár členských národů Koalice "
"fungující demokracii.\n"
"\n"
"Armáda Koalice je velká, rychlá a zákeřná. Je to jedna z nejelitnějších a "
"výborně vybavených sil na světě. Navíc užívá volnější pravidla boje než "
"Sjednocená Amerika nebo Asijská Republika. Jejich odstavec o 'přijatelných "
"civilních obětech' byl zdrojem obrovského množství kritiky z celého světa, "
"ale Koalice neústupně udržuje v platnosti tento odstavec po čtyři "
"desetiletí.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Nová Afrika:\n"
"\n"
"Zrozena z násilí a hádek, Nová Afrika nalezla svoji jednotnost v odloučení. "
"Po tři desetiletí 21. století postupně slábla, stejně jak to dělala již "
"dlouho před tím se svými občanskými válkami, etnickými čistkami a "
"nepředstavitelnými zvěrstvy. A to až do roku 2039, kdy několik států ze "
"střední Afriky podniklo masívní plán, který měl za úkol vypořádat se s "
"neblaze proslulými diamantovými kartely a vyvlastnit jejich příjmy pro "
"dlouhodobý národní pokrok.\n"
"\n"
"Ten však skončil krvavým vojenským a ekonomickým masakrem. Spojené Národy "
"zkusili různá opatření aby zastavili boje, ale bezzubější než kdykoliv "
"předtím nedosáhli ničeho. Nicméně ke svazu států se nakonec přidalo několik "
"dalších, zhnusených sekýrováním západních korporací a po několika letech "
"urputných bojů porazily kartely jeden po druhém. Tím jim zůstaly některé z "
"největších a nejrozvinutějších diamantových a zlatých dolů na světě; jejich "
"spojené území se tak stalo největším světovým dodavatelem pravých diamantů. "
"Zároveň získaly nový smysl čeho by mohly společně dosáhnout. Zrodilo se "
"jádro Nové Afriky.\n"
"\n"
"Všechny africké státy zapojené do antikartelové války, s výjimkou území "
"věrných Oceánskému Společenství a Středovýchodní Koalici, spolu začali "
"mnohem těsněji spolupracovat berouc si příklad z Jižní Ameriky v budování "
"spolehlivé sítě silnic pro podporu obchodu a komunikace. To zároveň umožnilo "
"mnohem lepší distribuci potravin. Během dalších třiceti let se Nová Afrika "
"úplně zbavila hladomoru uvnitř svých hranic, což ji zcela změnilo v "
"přizpůsobivé etnikum s touhou po nezávislosti uvnitř svých územní a s "
"obrovskými náklady přineslo veřejně dostupnou zdravotnickou péči jejím "
"lidem. Ale také byly v hospodářství objeveny nové možnosti vývozu, "
"udržitelný růst tropických tvrdých dřevin a exotického ovoce. Pravděpodobně "
"poprvé vytvořila tato nová spolupráce cenové smlouvy po celém kontinentu; "
"stejně jako Revoluční země přiměla Nová Afrika okolní svět aby obstojně "
"platil za veškeré zboží a služby.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Nová Afrika ekonomicky stále nejslabší z velmocí, ale rychle roste. "
"Má velkou motivovanou stálou armádu, ale vojáci jsou špatně vybaveni, "
"vyzbrojeni převážně starožitnostmi z bývalých Spojených států a více než "
"století starým sovětským vybavením. Mají také problémy s přesunem na "
"vzdálená místa díky častým poruchám na vybavení a složité geografii "
"kontinentu. Nejlepší možností je pro Nové Afričany partyzánský způsob boje, "
"kdy jsou po celé zemi rozprostřeny malé hlídky a přistání cizáckých plavidel "
"stopují tisíce průzkumníků.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rusko:\n"
"\n"
"Vzpamatování se z pádu Sovětského svazu a obnova sovětským systémem "
"vydrancované státní ekonomiky trvala Rusku několik desetiletí. Hnisalo jako "
"otevřená rána celou první polovinu 21. století, stále se snažilo potlačit "
"neustálá povstání v Čečensku, stále se snažilo reformovat po 70 letech "
"státní nadvlády, stále se snažilo získat zpátky ztracenou pozici světové "
"supervelmoci.\n"
"\n"
"Věci se pro Rusko konečně začaly zlepšovat když v roce 2047 tehdejší "
"předseda vlády Jevgenij Karamazov uznal úplnou nezávislost Čečenska. Zatímco "
"se v nově oficiální Čečenské republice strhla vlna násilí ve sporu kdo by "
"vlastně měl vládnout, Rusko dalo ruce pryč snažíc se vyrovnat s vlastními "
"problémy a ponechalo Čečensko svému osudu a novým vylepšeným Spojeným "
"Národům, které se okamžitě snažily zastavit krveprolití. To se bohužel "
"dlouho nedařilo a nakonec byla pro Čečensko jediná šance vrátit se do sféry "
"ruského vlivu, ale poprvé tak učinilo jako plnohodnotný nezávislý hlas.\n"
"\n"
"Ekonomická záchrana pro Rusko -- zvláště s tenčícími se dodávkami ropy ze "
"Středního východu -- začala novými postupy těžby vlastní ropy na Sibiři s "
"vybavením, které umožňovalo přežití v krutých zimních podmínkách a později "
"pokračovala výstavbou řady nových atomových elektráren. Rusko hodně "
"investovalo do výzkumu aby nové elektrárny byly menší, bezpečnější a hlavně "
"životaschopné. To vyžadovalo přechod z obohaceného uranu na thorium jako "
"hlavního jaderného paliva ve všech těchto elektrárnách a použití nové "
"zdokonalené konstrukce založené na 'energetickém zesilovači', novém typu "
"štěpného reaktoru poprvé testovaného nedaleko Říma v letech 2004 až 2011. "
"Dva z nových reaktorů dokonce zpracovávaly plutonium z demontovaných "
"jaderných zbraní a z uloženého odpadu starších elektráren.\n"
"\n"
"Osm let po Čečenské nezávislosti přišla skutečná Ruská 'atomová revoluce' s "
"vynálezem zpracování vyhořelého paliva, které bylo schopno přeměnit 90 % "
"odpadu z energetického zesilovače na neradioaktivní materiál během týdnů "
"místo několika století. Rusové ukončili letitou energetickou krizi víceméně "
"přes noc; jaderné štěpení se stalo bezpečným, poměrně čistým a celosvětové "
"zásoby thoria mohly zaručit čistotu Země až do roku 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes se mnoho bývalých sovětských států znovu připojilo k Rusku následujíc "
"příkladu ostatních mocností a dychtíc po výhodách, které přináší výroba "
"energie a jaderná technologie, které jsou teď hlavní Ruskou komoditou. "
"Atomová revoluce dokonce dále pokračuje díky pozvolnému rozvoji a "
"komercializaci fúzní energie. Přestože jejich ekonomika má stále problémy, "
"jejich země je na tom lépe než kdykoliv během posledních několika století, "
"ať za vlády chánů, carů nebo sovětů. Jejich armáda je poněkud zastaralá ale "
"profesionální, velice dobře vycvičená s dobrou disciplínou a nepostrádá "
"lidské zdroje.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Oceánské Společenství:\n"
"\n"
"Společenství národů, politická organizace složená převážně ze států starého "
"britského impéria, ztratilo velmi mnoho sil když vstoupilo do Druhé studené "
"války. Nejdříve Pákistán přetrhal vazby se Společenstvím když se připojil ke "
"Středovýchodní Koalici. Když se poté Spojené státy hroutily a kolabovaly, "
"začala se Británie a Kanada víc a víc zajímat jen o své vlastní části světa "
"a nechala svoji spoluúčast zcela vyprchat. V roce 2030 byly členy jen podle "
"jména.\n"
"\n"
"Rostoucí síla Číny během války způsobila obrovský nárůst ve vojenských "
"rozpočtech Indie a Austrálie a to takovým způsobem, že jejich ekonomika měla "
"problém je uspokojit. Poté se v roce 2035 Indie stala jedním velkým bojištěm "
"v Čínské občanské válce. Zkušení vládní válečníci snadno porazili Indickou "
"armádu v několika krátkých ale krvavých bitvách a ukořistili většinu země "
"zatímco je pronásledovali povstalci.\n"
"\n"
"Austrálie společně s několika jihoafrickými členy Společenství slíbila "
"rozsáhlý vojenský zákrok. Po týdnech ukrutných bojů se australským divizím "
"podařilo spojit se s čínskými povstaleckými silami a přeživšími pluky "
"indické armády a společně víceméně vyhladili vládní armádu předtím, než v "
"roce 2036 kapitulovala.\n"
"\n"
"Cena byla vysoká. Z dobyté části Indie byla pustina, po vyhlazení Nového "
"Dillí byla země bez vlády a obyvatelstvo začal sužovat hladomor. Začalo se s "
"předáváním bezcenných částí země ostatním státům a byla dána nezávislost "
"několika malým oblastem kolem hranic. Zbývající státy Společenství se ujaly "
"obrovského úkolu obnovy Indie, přestože mnoho z nich opustilo projekt a "
"Společenství a přidali se k ostatním rostoucím velmocem.\n"
"\n"
"Obnova Indie nakonec sjednotila Společenství v jeden velký národ, který "
"využíval se své geografické polohy kolem Indického oceánu a Jižního Pacifiku "
"a vybíral strategické clo od lodí, které křižovaly jejich vodami. Na druhou "
"stranu byla lodní doprava Společenství bezcelní a rychle se v konkurenčním "
"prostředí stala dominantní. Když byly později rozbity diamantové kartely v "
"Africe, Společenství zkonfiskovalo několik nespravovaných dolů uvnitř svých "
"hranic a zcela jich využilo.\n"
"\n"
"Dnes je Společenství národů známé spíše jako 'Oceánské Společenství' nebo "
"jenom 'Oceánie'. Od založení do svého středu přijalo několik zemí, které "
"nebyly ve Společenství, hlavně Madagaskar, Zimbabwe a Indonésii, čímž "
"rozšířili svůj vliv na vody Oceánie. Přestože stále nemohou ekonomicky "
"konkurovat bohatším národům, vytvořili si svůj vlastní kout a jsou zcela "
"spokojeni s tím jak se jim daří v něm prosperovat.\n"
"\n"
"Oceánská armáda spočívá hlavně v silném loďstvu. Jejich pozemní armáda je "
"nepatrná a v porovnání s jakoukoliv jinou kromě Sjednocené Ameriky a má "
"pouze obrannou funkci, je průměrně trénovaná a vybavená. Nicméně v krizových "
"situacích může zareagovat poměrně rychle."

"\"Projekt PHALANX\" byl poprvé založen Ministerstvem obrany Spojených států "
"v roce 1955 po létech vzrůstajícího zájmu o celosvětově rostoucí počet "
"pozorování UFO. Možnost cizácké invaze těžce sužovala mysli politiků "
"vynervovaných jadernou silou Sovětského svazu. Existence nepřátelského "
"mimozemského života ve vesmíru se zdála jako velice nepatrná možnost, "
"dokonce ještě menší než že by tito nepřátelé mohli najít Zemi obklopenou "
"celým širým prostorem -- ale mohla si Amerika dovolit takové riziko?\n"
"\n"
"Zastánci projektu strávili dva roky budováním podpory v nejvyšších vládních "
"kruzích. Konečně, v roce 1957, PHALANX dostal svoji první finanční dotaci. "
"Podstatná část ročního 'černého rozpočtu' padla na výstavbu vyspělého "
"podzemního komplexu v Nevadské poušti kdesi v prostoru letecké základny "
"Nellis. Komplex byl pojmenován \"Velitelství tichomořských operací PHALANX"
"\", vybaven nejmodernějším zařízením a osazen těmi nejlepšími s jasnou vizí "
"jak nejlépe bojovat proti mimozemské invazi na americkou půdu.\n"
"\n"
"Ve svých počátcích byl projekt ohromný úspěch, pod jeho záštitou byly "
"vyvíjeny průkopnické technologie a vyráběny funkční prototypy věcí, které "
"svět nikdy předtím neviděl. A to vše za zlomek nákladů které by měli "
"podnikatelé v civilním sektoru. Díky své skutečné podstatě byl PHALANX "
"předmětem každoročních bitev o finanční rozpočet, ale jeho výzkumné a "
"vývojové úspěchy byly pokaždé důvodem pokračovat dokonce i pro nekompromisní "
"praktiky.\n"
"\n"
"Zatímco PHALANX se stále připravoval na něco, co se nikdy nestalo, svět se "
"bohužel vydal jiným směrem. Válka ve Vietnamu přinesla obrovský nárůst ve "
"vojenských výdajích a jen velice málo bylo přiděleno PHALANXu nebo podobným "
"projektům. Ti viděli své rozpočty seškrtané a spálené tváří v tvář válce. "
"Navzdory opakovaným žádostem o více financí se Generální štáb vzdal "
"exotického programu z roku 1950 jako zbytečného mrhání penězi a nechal ho "
"pokračovat pouze kvůli jeho výzkumným snahám. Většina zbylých financí šla na "
"udržení starého vybavení v provozuschopném stavu. Pokud laboratoře pracovaly "
"tak jen s obtížemi.\n"
"\n"
"Po válce již nebyl PHALANX zcela obnoven a už nikdy nezískal finance které "
"měl v padesátých letech -- roky slávy pominuly. V rámci projektu sice "
"vznikla nějaká nová technologie použitá při Válce v zálivu a díky "
"stoupajícímu rozpočtu Americké armády v prvních letech 21. století nastal "
"krátký návrat na výsluní, ale po těchto záblescích tvořivosti projekt opět "
"upadl v zapomnění.\n"
"\n"
"Druhá studená válka vysála z projektu poslední známky života. Velitelé "
"bojovali o jeho přežití dokonce bez peněz potřebných k udržení "
"provozuschopných letounů, nicméně i vynalezení umělého pavoučího hedvábí je "
"nemohlo zachránit před krachující ekonomikou Spojených států. Státní úpadek "
"do zkázy utáhl opasek všem 'nepodstatným' vojenským programům v zemi, "
"jednomu po druhém. PHALANX byl nakonec stažen z rozpočtu v roce 2027, pět "
"měsíců před jeho 70. výročím. Zaměstnanci byli propuštěni, základna "
"vyklizena, jedinečné vybavení zakonzervováno a uloženo do skladu. Projekt "
"byl rychle zapomenut.\n"
"\n"
"Dokud nebyl znovu objeven 9. března 2084 starým mužem, který se rozpomněl, "
"že o něm četl v zaprášeném archívu ve své dávno zbořené kanceláři.\n"
"\n"
"Hrůza a ohavnost událostí v Bombaji otřásla celým světem. Existence "
"inteligentního cizáckého života ve vesmíru již nebyla věcí víry. Nejenže "
"existoval, ale provedl kontakt tou nejhorší možnou cestou. Krveprolití byla "
"natolik rozsáhlá a očividná, že je vlády na celé Zemi nebyly schopny "
"ututlat. Obraz kouřících zakrvácených ulic ukazovaly televizory na celém "
"světě. Cizáci nenechali žádný jiný důkaz své návštěvy. Než odtáhli tak "
"pečlivě shromáždili své mrtvé a sebrali každý kousek upadlé techniky.\n"
"\n"
"Panika se šířila jako požár bezprostředně za Bombajským vysíláním a věci se "
"ještě zhoršili jak se široká veřejnost dozvěděla o jatkách v Bonnu, "
"Johannesburgu a Bangkoku. Svět věděl, že byl navštíven a nyní si začínal "
"uvědomovat, že byl napaden.\n"
"\n"
"Hledání nějakých řešení bylo zoufalé. Spojené Národy zasedaly nepřetržitě "
"déle než týden. Rychlostí světla byly plány navrhovány a hned zas házeny do "
"koše. Svět byl proti cizácké invazi naprosto bezbranný a to jak vojensky tak "
"psychologicky. Na tohle nebyl nikdo připraven. Byl to jeden ze zapomenutých "
"scénářů o konci světa, které se rozpadaly v prach v zapadlém kumbálu jakési "
"kanceláře pro plánování strategie, nepřečtený a nepovšimnutý. Leč veřejnost "
"požadovala odpovědi které nikdo neznal a činnost kterou nikdo nedokázal "
"zajistit.\n"
"\n"
"Spojené Národy schválily pouze s pár symbolických gest: z rozkazu Rady "
"bezpečnosti NASA evakuovala Mezinárodní vesmírné stanice 1 a 2, stejně jako "
"stálou kolonii na Měsíci. Veškeré plánované mise na Mars byly odloženy na "
"neurčito. Ve všech ostatních důležitých záležitostech byly Spojené Národy v "
"koncích. Některé státy chtěly vybudovat obrovské orbitální opevnění, jiné "
"naléhaly, aby směly zastavit UFO použitím jaderných střel. Ostatní "
"prosazovaly ještě exotičtější projekty. Situace byla den ode dne horší dokud "
"si jeden postarší diplomat nevzpomněl na projekt PHALANX.\n"
"\n"
"S úplným přístupem ke starým americkým záznamům SN s překvapením nalezly "
"plány, návrhy, vybavení a výcvikové příručky -- podrobně propracovanou "
"reakci na obdobnou invazi. Okamžitě se rozhodly obnovit PHALANX a vybavit ho "
"k obraně Země před cizáckou hrozbou. Bohužel všichni kteří někdy byli "
"součástí PHALANXu byli mrtví nebo umírali. Bylo třeba dát dohromady nový "
"personál.\n"
"\n"
"Jednohlasně bylo rozhodnuto uchovat projekt tak tajný jak to jen bude možné, "
"známý pouze nejvyšším světovým politikům a vojenským velitelům. Veřejnost "
"byla uchlácholena krycí legendou a vlídnou lží zatímco vybraný tým agentů z "
"celého světa usiloval o oživení PHALANXu a jeho návrat do vrcholné formy. "
"Bylo vyhledáno a ze zapadlých skladišť zachráněno staré vybavení, oprášeny "
"rozpadající se příručky a uskladněné zbraně znovu sestaveny. S tajnou "
"finanční podporou všech osmi velmocí měl projekt zázemí, podporu a lidi. To "
"vše potřeboval aby mohl vstoupit do války.\n"
"\n"
"Jediné co scházelo byl vůdce."

"\n"
"You need to read this right away. By your request, we've performed several "
"hurried autopsies and done our best to examine the live prisoners taken on "
"our mission against the alien sympathisers. The results are alarming.\n"
"\n"
"Do you remember the report I sent you about the first live alien specimen we "
"researched? As you may remember, it had lost all its intellect and became "
"largely unresponsive without fellows to empower the hive mind. Prepare "
"yourself, Commander: The human prisoner in our Containment unit exhibits the "
"very same symptoms. A thorough blood analysis has produced conclusive "
"evidence that the prisoner is infected with an XVI strand.\n"
"\n"
"This new strand is slightly different from the others we've encountered, and "
"we fear it can only be designated \"XVI-H\". It appears to be willfully "
"designed to infect humans with the alien hive mind. It overrides their own "
"rational thought processes and replaces them with a direct link into the "
"group, whether there actually is a group or not, through a process we "
"currently fail to understand. Our subjects run the gamut of the human race; "
"the infection seems to have no preference for IQ or physical potential. The "
"infection method appears to be a direct injection of infected blood into the "
"victim's bloodstream. It is premeditated and ruthless. Any amount of shared "
"blood is enough for the infection to take root.\n"
"\n"
"Quarantine procedures have been tightened to the absolute maximum, and we're "
"rushing another full batch of tests on all our personnel. Our field agents "
"remain clean, thank God -- just think if we'd gone into a combat zone with "
"soldiers capable of turning on their teammates at any moment! -- but I fear "
"we have found one conclusive result. It's Dr. Eisenhower, our Director of "
"Administration. He's been away on holiday since last week, but we ran an "
"older sample which has now come up positive. We don't know when or how he "
"was subverted or if he even joined PHALANX with honourable intentions, but "
"it's clear he has acted as an alien spy for some weeks. Unfortunately we "
"can't seem to find him at his announced destination. Internal Security has "
"taken charge of his workstation and is in the process of information "
"control.\n"
"\n"
"Things are a bit hectic right now. Dr. Eisenhower's infection implies that "
"other members of a hive mind -- human or alien -- were in close enough "
"proximity to allow him to function at human intelligence. He could have "
"linked up with our subjects in Containment, or a nearby alien cell, or even "
"other infiltrators inside our base. Right now, we don't know, and we most "
"likely never will. We're all frightened in the Bio lab. My assistant has "
"been jumping at shadows all day.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we must develop a vaccine against XVI-H as soon as possible. The "
"danger of our soldiers and salvage technicians falling victim to the "
"infection in the field is too great to ignore even for a moment. I hereby "
"request your permission to start work on a vaccine immediately. Please, "
"please respond at your earliest convenience.\n"

"\n"
"My team and I are deeply troubled by the recent reports of human hostility "
"against PHALANX personnel, as I'm sure you are. We've all seen the "
"battlefield footage. There's no doubt that the attackers were humans like "
"you and me, but it's also clear they were using alien weaponry and equipment "
"-- some of which even PHALANX has never seen before.\n"
"\n"
"The worrying questions seem to mount up. First, however, we need to review "
"the facts we have.\n"
"\n"
"Do the aliens have active sympathisers on Earth? Yes.\n"
"\n"
"Are the aliens supplying these human servants? Affirmative; it's the only "
"explanation for their advanced alien equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Do the servants present a threat? Absolutely. Perhaps a greater one than the "
"alien menace itself.\n"
"\n"
"We need to delve deeper into what makes these people tick. If we can find "
"out the most common causes for alien infiltration, our Information Division "
"should be able to devise a far more successful propaganda strategy, which "
"could increase our number of volunteers as well as decrease the alien "
"infiltration rate across the globe. The DivBio also has a stake; we'd like "
"to capture at least one live prisoner for our Containment unit so we can run "
"a full physical examination. If the aliens have bodily altered these humans "
"in addition to training and supplying them, we'd like to find out about it.\n"
"\n"
"Director Wong (DivInfo) also asked me to mention that, if we hold off on "
"implementing a new info strategy for too long, we could soon face "
"recruitment shortfalls and increased human resistance as the sympathisers "
"begin getting their word out. I tend to agree. We need to keep this planet "
"together if we are to have any chance against the alien threat.\n"
