"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to "
"replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of "
"dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
"dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got "
"out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving "
"examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government "
"warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of "
"storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even "
"find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best "
"to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade "
"our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four "
"HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The "
"HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered "
"aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose. It can also carry "
"additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 light weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated "
"fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO "
"sighting.\n"

"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"长官，我在您来之前翻阅了一下旧档案，我决定将档案更新为我个人对登陆机的评论。"
"如果我这样做超越了我的权限我表示道歉，但PHALANX存储的旧登陆机根本达不到现代的"
"标准。而且还只是原型机，只有两种型号，这两种航空机在仓库里已经找不到了，在过"
"去60年中都从仓库里清除了。我们继承的是一个真正的烂摊子，几乎找不到什么可用的"
"东西。我所能做的只是尽力找到合适的替代品。\n"
"\n"
"好运气是找到了这种登陆机，我设法说服联合国给我们一些预算定制新的航空机，我想"
"你会喜欢的。\n"
"\n"
"火鸟级垂直起降机非常适合作我们的登陆机。它的设计目的是作为货运机，但很快就被"
"军火商选来改编为运输部队的飞机。不管是军事用途还是民间使用，它现在是最流行的"
"直升机替代机。它有四个HM－5600脉冲爆震发动机，提供了垂直起降能力，比任何直升"
"机引擎都有更好的燃油效率。这全面增加了系统的可靠性，由于不需要转子叶片速度也"
"提高了很多。HM－5600是非常棒的引擎。当然对于民用来说高功率的航空燃料就太贵"
"了。\n"
"\n"
"火鸟级的巡航速度为0.74马赫。最高速度1.03马赫勉强可以突破音障，这会对机身造成"
"很大的负担，应当避免使用最高速度，当然紧急情况另说。位于鼻子部位有一个可变武"
"器挂载槽，可以安装机炮或导弹发射器等防空武器。它还可以携带更多的设备来改善其"
"飞行特性和作战能力。机舱可以容纳八个士兵，还有一个货舱可以放置小型战场车"
"辆。\n"
"\n"
"其他航空机都不如火鸟级更适合作我们的登陆机。它的速度超过了任何一种直升机，机"
"动能力超过了任何一种固定翼飞机，它可以迅速的把人员送到世界各个地区。\n"
"\n"
"火鸟级需要大型机用平台来存储，维护和部署，可以挂载一个中型武器。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"这种登陆机可以把我们的士兵运到世界各地，诸如被外星攻击的地区或UFO坠毁点等等。"
"一旦有事情发生就应该立即派遣登陆机到出事地点。\n"
"\n"
"当有威胁的异形被清理干净以后，受重伤的士兵将立即送去治疗。其他部队将协助维护"
"该地区安全，一直到PHALANX清理完战场。这很重要的，在人口稠密地区企图抢劫遗留在"
"战场上物品的问题很严重。我们不能失去任何宝贵的外星技术，一定要防止那些白痴去"
"收取纪念品。\n"

"Commander, I'm pleased to present the schematics for the Herakles-class "
"Heavy Lifter.\n"
"\n"
"To speed the development of this dropship, we adapted the design from an "
"existing airborne lifter vehicle that is used in the civilian sector for the "
"movement of extremely heavy goods. The craft consists of a lifting vehicle "
"and a dead pod -- an inert cargo container that we have converted to house "
"up to 12 troops.\n"
"\n"
"The craft has VTOL capabilities, but we've upgraded the propulsion systems "
"to achieve faster cruising speeds. We've also encased both the vehicle and "
"the pod in advanced armour plating that relies on human-sourced materials to "
"keep costs down. The Herakles should get our soldiers on-site faster and "
"safer than the firebird.\n"
"\n"
"Like the Firebird, we have incorporated a single light weapon hardpoint in "
"the nose, but this is only for last-ditch defensive efforts. The Herakles is "
"a troop transport and should be kept safe from any armed UFOs.\n"
"\n"
"We should get at least one of these built as soon as possible. We won't need "

"Aircraft Evaluation -- Stiletto-class Interceptor\n"

"CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 04 November 2026\n"
"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
"generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests "
"with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest "
"piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "
"speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air "
"channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and "
"redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They "
"are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can "
"hover unassisted for an extended period before burning through all their "
"fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "
"complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at "
"all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire "
"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"
"the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not "
"limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and "
"optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed "
"in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can "
"actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of "
"armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. "
"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
"Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its "
"maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within "
"this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
"recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
"described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 heavy wing "
"mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
"threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with "
"anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed "
"against distant targets as it won't have enough fuel for both attack "
"manoeuvres and the flight back to base.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but "
"the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for "
"us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race "
"is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
"person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
"little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they "
"held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most "
"manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and "
"can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern "
"aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at "
"speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. "
"However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can "
"handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track "
"down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being "
"restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight "
"testing on my own authority.\n"
"\n"
"This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. "
"We're going to need it."

"我很高兴向大家报告，我们下一代迎击机的原型机已经造好了，并且通过了所有的飞行"
"测试。可以夸大其词的说这是人类历史最好的产品。\n"
"\n"
"蜻蜓级是一种单座空中战斗机，具有垂直起降能力，可以在小型机场起飞降落。即时在"
"超音速的时候，巨大的高性能涡轮风扇发动机也可以360度全回旋。发动机进气口有先进"
"的空气输送系统，前部的空气过滤器可以过滤任何会损害涡轮风扇的杂物。所带燃料可"
"以让航空机在空中悬停长达2个小时。\n"
"\n"
"外形很像直升机，可以欺骗敌人误以为它的飞行速度不快。蜻蜓级的紧凑机身必要时能"
"在很短的时间内加速到2马赫，它的巡航速度是1.3马赫，最高速度是2.1马赫。蜻蜓级的"
"这些性能远远超出了一般的军用喷气式战斗机。\n"
"\n"
"在空中，经验丰富的飞行员可以把它驾驭的像兔子一样灵活。他可以横向移动6秒，同时"
"还能保持其机头机炮一直都对准目标。在被隐形飞机导弹锁定的时候需要0.3秒就可以完"
"成翻转动作。\n"
"\n"
"导弹发射器安装在外翼两侧。蜻蜓级还具有强大的电子作战能力，在其鼻子部位安装有"
"美国最先进的传感器组件，其中包括--并不限于--激光探测器、先进的雷达系统、光学"
"成像器等等，性能不亚于任何间谍卫星。小型ECM发射器排放在整个机身，必要时可以放"

"\n"
"请注意，正因为它的性能卓越，不建议让新手飞行员驾驶。其反应速度可能跟不上飞机"

"\n"
"蜻蜓级是理想的短程迎击机，可以对付威胁PHALANX基地的目标。它可以近距离的打赢任"
"何地球上的目标。蜻蜓级不能追踪距离超过2000公里的目标，它没有那么多的燃料。空"
"中加油可能可以延长作战半径，但那需要更多的研究。\n"

"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
"and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts into weapons capacity. The "
"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "
"nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to "
"dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the "
"Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that "
"implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain "
"effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. "
"It has 2 medium weapon hardpoints.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
"extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed "
"by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of "
"the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the "
"aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be "
"measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat "
"encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able "
"to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"Commander, I'm extremely proud to present you with the plans for our new "
"interceptor, the Dragon. As you can see we've taken more than one page out "
"of the aliens' book and the radical styling truly pays off.\n"
"\n"
"Incorporating new technologies from the ground up, the Dragon consists of an "
"inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer "
"skin of carbon nanotube-reinforced plastics. This allows it to mount two "
"actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our "
"arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-"

"\n"
"The three-pronged fuselage is also inspired by the enemy, slicing through "
"the air with remarkable grace. The upper two prongs can mount onboard "
"electronics to enhance evasion and targeting. Two heavy weapon hardpoints "
"are located in the center -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the "
"Dragon was named.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter "
"to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the "
"fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we "

"The first thing you'll notice is its distinctive shape and armour plating. I "
"know some of the pilots who had a look at the early drawings were a little "

"this aircraft's design is there for a reason. We chucked out all of our "

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien expeditions. It "
"is frequently deployed to engage aerial targets or even as a diversion to "
"mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly "
"fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side "
"to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter "
"engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This "
"weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough "
"research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, "
"it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely "
"dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of "
"light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or "
"disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it "
"mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting "
"computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air "
"engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us "
"to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster "
"than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a "
"craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull "
"materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The "
"aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current "
"technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "
"armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few "
"tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to "
"be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO "
"does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will "
"not be enough to harm nearby craft.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. However, their "
"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "
"than armed reconnaissance.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some "
"kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and a sizeable team of "
"aliens in a passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance "
"has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading "
"material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply "
"ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo "
"we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship "
"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "
"in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our "
"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs "
"we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The "
"long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately "
"apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"\n"
"We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal "
"about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs "
"twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of heavy "
"fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.\n"
"\n"
"The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very "
"interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost "
"identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. It seems like the "
"aliens have actually adapted our design for their own use and may begin "
"using different loadouts on individual craft. If the aliens are actually "
"learning from us, we could be in for a hell of a ride . . .\n"
"\n"
"Even more interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the "
"standard skin of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading UFOs. "
"This new armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and various "

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
"specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
"harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
"and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew "
"has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the "
"UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is "
"they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the "
"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and "
"more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion "
"does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely "
"strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
"possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "
"full.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the "
"craft's cockpit, each equipped with the particle beam weapon we've observed "
"in other UFOs.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Its firepower is more than a match for anything we can "
"currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared "
"to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we "
"have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This "
"is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, but in most "
"cases it won't be sufficient unless we upgrade our aerial capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on a Harvester to "
"take it out as fast as possible.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some "
"frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as "
"they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can "
"build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without "
"upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous "
"threats in the future.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the "
"globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the "
"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar "
"first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar "
"were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of "
"Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, "
"throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth "
"technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence "
"later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't "
"shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be "
"fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls "
"under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve "
"to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, "
"decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) "
"on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is "
"clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the "
"most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is "
"the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, "
"tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit "
"will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and "
"other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as "
"their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as "
"easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides "
"a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a "
"complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its "
"price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry "
"either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft "
"Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the "
"\"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The "
"expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will "
"certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"\n"
"Of course, before you get too excited, let me stress that we have not found "
"a magic path through the aliens' defences. Regardless of what we take away "
"from this research, it's not going to end the war or make UFOs any less "
"dangerous. This is because of the EW suite's most important function -- it "
"has an independent onboard intelligence that adapts to its combat "

"\n"
"This intelligence is continually experimenting, trying to keep enemy systems "
"off-balance, changing its methods and deviating from its preferred "
"frequencies to try ones that might be more difficult to work with but could "
"bypass enemy jamming. We even believe that, when patched into a UFO's main "
"computer, this suite will hook into other onboard systems to make efficiency-"
"increasing adjustments based on enemy EW activity. Particularly to the "
"targeting computers.\n"
"\n"
"Besides the intelligent computer at its heart, the suite has projectors of "
"every kind, capable of saturating virtually any frequency in the "
"electromagnetic spectrum, even several frequencies at a time. It is also "
"capable of 'throwing' heat several metres away from the craft, causing "

"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide.\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and decrease "
"its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range "
"interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far "
"distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here "
"is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
"core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
"specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
"course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
"astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of "
"this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
"astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
"system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
"intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', "
"'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters "
"can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you "
"want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when "
"plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do "
"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "
"found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs "
"with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for "
"navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "
"far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of "
"the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon "
"of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as "
"the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system "
"plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information "
"will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of "
"knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into "
"the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but "
"I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared "
"to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with "
"these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we "
"could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we "
"could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will "
"greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point "
"where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click "
"of a button.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. "
"We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally "
"understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike "
"any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to "
"generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction "
"chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the "
"engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to "
"fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-"
"advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the "
"engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. "
"Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are "
"constructed, how to control them, and how we might be able to use them in "
"new aircraft designs. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely "
"expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the "
"sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this "
"really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and "
"control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just "
"an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these "
"matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start "
"using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious "
"re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a "
"tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the "
"force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. "
"The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human "
"body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have "
"trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to "
"be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and "
"other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may "
"result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust "
"limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during "
"turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and "
"mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done "
"some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for "
"antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining "
"obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"我要告诉你， 这个的生产是极其昂贵。 要融合复杂的外星材料， 敏感的电磁设备， "
"还有液氮冷却系统， 这是我们生产工艺的最大挑战。\n"

"擎装到人类制造的设备上而已。 我们应该开始着手改造升级， 一旦我们获得足够的燃"
"料我们的航空机就能自由翱翔了。\n"
"\n"
"前面已经提到， 液体燃料引擎和反物质引擎的差距是惊人的。 当我们开始在我们的航"
"空机上使用这些引擎的时候， 我们的飞行员将需要重新训练。 以下让我解释一下。\n"
"\n"
"在一般的正规军用飞机上， 如果飞机加速过快可能会导致飞行员判断力丧失， 或进入"

"\n"
"在反物质推力飞机上， 这些问题就放大了100倍。 该引擎是如此强大， 加速过载会把"

"属疲劳，细微裂缝和其他机身磨损等等， 这些都需要我们的机械师频繁的作定期检"
"查。 任何的微小的裂缝都可能会让我们的飞机发生空难。 限速系统对此也毫无办法。 "
"大多数加速度都是发生在速度转换的时候。\n"

"of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is designed for close-range dogfighting. For this reason, we "
"recommend it should be part of a larger armaments pack that includes longer-"
"range weapons where possible. When closing on an enemy it is extremely "
"deadly, but if it is the only weapon available to a pilot he will be "
"vulnerable during the long approach.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"现在我们有迎击机可以拦截攻击UFO，我们需要给他们装备武器让他们可以击落UFO。神"
"剑计划的一部分工作就是挑选地球上现在可用的武器，我们选择了最好的武器来防卫我"
"们的地球。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA是一个四管旋转炮，使用20毫米炮弹。它使用一个外部电机来产生电力驱动，而不"
"是依赖后座力。电动机能提供20马力让SHIVA一分钟射速高达6000发。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA是孟加拉国在2048年发明的，当时差点失败。2050年7月一项内部调查才发现竞争"
"对手搞了很长一段时间的阴谋破坏。新的原型炮证明了设计的成功。最终所有的主要缺"
"陷都消除了，这种武器显的更为突出。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA对于航空机武器而言很轻，仅重250公斤，装弹后400公斤。射速超过任何其他四管"
"加农炮。火力瞄准只需一个雷达或激光瞄准系统。装弹系统非常可靠，从服役至今没有"
"任何卡弹记录。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA可以使用两种弹药：穿甲弹或爆破弹。前者有很好的穿透性，而后者在能穿透装甲"
"的时候威力更好。这两种弹药已证明能够在一定程度上破坏UFO。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA最大的问题是，它对UFO只有有限的破坏效果，长时间火力接触才能击落目标。这"
"让敌人很容易逃跑或反击。另一方面，大型弹夹带来的持续火力也是其他武器没有，这"
"一点不容低估。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA的火力小，需要长时间火力才有好的效果。不过，如果混合其他导弹武器装备，这"

"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. "
"The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the "

"one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't "
"hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance "
"systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply "
"not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, "
"and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding "

"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "
"eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket "
"actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can "
"fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "
"greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared "
"to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely "
"to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against light UFOs. Because it "
"only requires a medium-weight hardpoint, it should be installed on lighter "
"aircraft. In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, "
"tearing mercilessly into a target. However, its limited range and accuracy "
"lead me to recommend that the Sparrowhawk Missile Rack be preferred in any "
"weapon hardpoint capable of mounting heavy weapons.\n"

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical "
"system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"长官，这里是粒子束武器的研究报告。\n"

"能。外星粒子束发射器基本上是一个大型粒子加速器加一套焦点设备，其中包括有高功"
"率的磁场约束系统。\n"
"\n"
"我的小组可以制造几乎相同标准的粒子加速器，而且效果比外星人的还好。这个加速器"
"是高能量同步加速器，通过一个圆圈加速粒子，直到他们达到足够的速度，然后通过改"
"变磁场阵列，将粒子团磁约束成为一个连续的光束。在磁场控制水平上外星人的技术比"
"我们高很多。UFO上的电脑可以智能控制磁场阵列系统瞄准目标，其精确性很高。\n"
"\n"
"UFO的动力系统直接给发射器供电，电脑控制发射器持续不断的跟踪选择的目标。一旦目"
"标被摧毁，电脑会立即锁定的下一个存在的敌对目标。\n"

"长官，防御这种武器是一个很大的挑战。很少有东西可以抵抗粒子束的攻击。组合装甲"
"也不是很有效，如果是直接命中关键部位，那组合装甲也挡不住这样的攻击。唯一现实"
"的防御措施似乎只有指望误导敌人。我们应该尽快俘获和研究外星飞船的电子作战设"

"\n"
"同样的挑战是将粒子束发射器应用在我们自己的航空机上。我们现在可以将发射器安装"
"到任何一个中型挂载上，但是没有足够的电力能启动这个发射器。如果我们想在战斗中"
"使用粒子束，那我们必须关闭引擎的反物质动力系统才能启动发射器。这会需要更多的"

"Commander, we've finished work on the alien missile launcher. It's a fairly "
"simple affair. Firing is computer-driven, fed directly from the UFO's "

"accelerate the missile to extreme speeds, reaching up to Mach 4 at the point "
"where the missile leaves the tube. Only once the missile is fully free of "
"the tube do its onboard rockets kick in.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"We've determined that the modular equipment bays on our aircraft can be used "
"to accept extra fuel reserves. By installing these special but very simple "
"fuel pods, we can greatly increase the range of an aircraft by loading more "
"fuel on board.\n"
"\n"
"Take note, however, that installing a fuel pod will add a significant amount "
"of weight to the craft, slowing it down.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should make use of these pods in any situation where our aircraft are "
"unable to reach their destinations or where a large section of ground is "
"left uncovered by our network of bases. They will help to extend our reach "
"and provide more protection to Earth and our people.\n"

"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 20 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Having read Cdr. Navarre's report, Commander, I have to stress that our "
"charter stipulates we must stop any and all alien activity on Earth. We "
"can't afford to let some of it continue because it's just out of our planes' "
"reach. If civilians were to die because the dropship couldn't quite make it, "
"our image would be shattered and our funding may suffer the consequences. We "
"should keep some fuel pod-equipped planes on standby to deal with distant "

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
"combat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't "

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"我的团队已经解剖了那具灰色的异形尸体。这里是我总结的调查结果。\n"
"\n"
"当联军第一次抵达孟买的时候，感到十分困惑和忧虑。周围聚集了发疯的人群，那些人"
"既绝望又害怕。大部分士兵不会当地的语言，根本无法理解他们说什么。当问他们发生"

"\n"
"随着灾难的蔓延，这个词也缩短到“Taama”，最后这个词固定为“Taman”（发音为'塔"

"\n"
"最有趣的是，这个东西看起来像人类。两条胳膊，两条腿，一个躯干一个头，同样也是"
"直立行走，视觉、嗅觉和听觉器官也都在相同的位置。不同的是手和脚都是三个指头，"
"其中有一个是拇指。这个东西身材比人类瘦小。\n"
"\n"
"躯体内部有一套非常简单的重要器官，心脏、肺、肝等等。它没有什么多余或陈旧的器"

"共有三个类似肚子的器官，用来消化坚硬的植物物质，但不能消化任何肉类物质。这意"
"味着，无论Taman来自何方，也只是草食动物。这一发现多少给我们一些安慰，至少我们"
"不用担心异形是来吃我们肉的。\n"
"\n"
"在喉咙还有一套复杂的植入装置，这还需要进一步研究才能了解其作用。关于这个我会"
"寄给您更详细的研究草案。\n"
"\n"
"Taman的超大眼睛有夜视能力。它具有特殊的虹膜，来保护视网膜不受阳光等亮光的伤"
"害。但虹膜对突然产生的高亮度照明是来不及调整的，这可能会导致长期或永久失明。"
"估计我们的闪光棒就可以达到相似效果。\n"
"\n"
"灰色的皮肤有一个特别的功能。实际上，它会分泌微量的硅，这样就给他们柔顺皮肤提"
"供了一种天然的盔甲。Taman对冲撞和炎热有很好的抵御能力。\n"
"\n"
"根据我们的分析，我们得出的结论有以下几点：\n"
"\n"
"-Taman对子弹和钝性外伤有天然的防护能力，但也并不是刀枪不入。\n"
"\n"
"-他们的皮肤比较耐热，但还是无法抵挡火焰喷射器一类的大量伤害，能减少部分激光伤"
"害。\n"
"\n"
"-尽管Taman身体很柔软并具有弹性，但还是缺乏对内部器官的保护，爆炸性弹药的震荡"
"很容易就能伤害他们。\n"
"\n"
"进一步的研究已经排除了所谓的野生人类理论。虽然Taman外观很像人，好像意味着有某"
"种关系，但这只是进化趋势造成的（两种不同的进化路径，最终结果却很相似）。Taman"
"的基因序列和人类很少有相似之处，他们的DNA结构比我们的要复杂好几个数量级。这基"
"本已排除假设的同一起源。\n"
"\n"
"在战斗中，Taman是一个非常大的威胁。他们高度灵活，能够掌握各种武器的准确性。除"
"了充当士兵，在异形的战争机器中他们还充当其他专业角色，而且数量似乎也是最为众"
"多的。与任何其他物种相比，Taman对复杂武器和先进护甲往往掌握的很快。这很可能是"
"因为它有庞大的大脑和灵敏的感觉器官以及灵活的操纵器官。\n"
"\n"
"Taman是不是以前UFO传说里的小灰人，我不能肯定，但看起来极不可能。PHALANX始终无"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans, possessing "
"digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this "
"species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely "
"blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to "
"process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to "
"make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They seem to wear no armour to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"They sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these "
"tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"长官,\n"
"\n"
"我们解剖这个新的外星物种--Shevaar--发现很有趣。它和像人的Taman和Ortnok非常不"
"同，有一双趾行动物的腿和一个小尾巴，好像是没有完全进化遗留下来的。而且它也没"
"有眼睛，可以说是完全失明，看不到可见光。然而，它有一些其他有趣的器官来弥补这"
"一缺陷。\n"
"\n"
"首先，Shevaar外形看起来像是人和蜥蜴的合成体。和大多数地球上蜥蜴相比，这个物种"
"是温血动物，而且其大脑的大小类似于我们自己人类--也许比我们的还大一点。巨大的"
"双脚弹性很好，它可以长期以跨越式的步态来行走。巨大的双手也可以毫无问题的使用"
"各种外星武器。\n"
"\n"
"尸体解剖的结果也同样很有趣。切开胸部以后，我们发现它的骨骼很结实，和我们不"
"同，主要成分是碳而不是钙，还含有以其他金属成分。整个肋骨包裹着胸腔内部就像一"
"面坚硬的盾牌，用来抵挡刀和子弹的伤害，避免内部的重要器官受到损害。不光这样，"
"全身还布满了金属肌肉。\n"
"\n"
"大脑的保护也很特别。好几层的金属角捆绕在一起，就像坚不可摧的头盔。从角的磨损"
"痕迹来看，我们猜测，这种异形可能像动物一样经常通过相互头顶来进行某种交配前的"
"仪式。嘴巴凸出但很小，消化管道的结构比较简单。\n"
"\n"
"头部不仅仅只有大脑和嘴，还有其他的器官。在卷发状骨头的后面有三个器官构成的组"
"织，好像可以发现红外辐射。这显然是Shevaar用来代替眼睛的器官。我们的数据分析结"
"果是，这个器官的效果和佩戴标准红外护目镜的PHALANX士兵差不多。\n"
"\n"
"通过解剖和战场分析，我们得出以下几点结论：\n"
"\n"
"-Shevaar可以看见红外光。要想在它们面前隐藏或偷偷靠近它们将非常困难。\n"
"\n"
"-它们大多使用轻型武器以便能保持他们的灵活性。这使它们能够很有效的运用打了就跑"
"的战术。\n"
"\n"
"-Shevaar的身体有很高的耐冲击性，并且不怕切割伤害，它紧凑的内部结构也不容易被"
"爆炸震荡伤害。然而，它们的鳞片对火、电、激光没有什么防护功能。\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar通常被用作快速装甲侦察兵。它们也非常适合充当这个角色，快速移动能力和发"
"达的视野是它们最有效的工具，似乎它们的数量也不少。Shevaar的地位看起来像是位于"
"Taman和Ortnok之间，因为它们有时也会充当指挥的角色，不像Ortnok，但如果和Taman"
"在一起往往都是由Taman发号施令的。\n"
"\n"
"在没有战斗的时候，Shevaar大部分时间都在作警戒侦查或者看押被俘的人类。\n"
"\n"
"在喉咙还有一套复杂的植入装置，这还需要进一步研究才能了解其作用。关于这个我会"
"寄给您更详细的研究草案。\n"
"\n"
"我们应该小心这些Shevaar。它们是快速危险的精锐侦查兵，在我们队伍战斗线过长的时"
"候，它会对我们产生很大威胁。如果Shevaar绕到我们小队暴露的侧翼或后方，那后果不"
"堪设想。即使是手榴弹也不可能一次就彻底的杀死任何Shevaar，他们会飞快的从我们的"
"视线中逃走。\n"
"\n"
"另外，虽然Shevaar是失明的，但还是可能会受到闪光雷的影响，因为它和人类一样也是"
"有一个受声音影响的平衡器官。\n"

"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "

"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting "

"Commander, we've successfully prototyped our new powered armour. The "
"prototype is waiting in R&D if you'd like to have a go in it yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Our production design is geared towards maximum protection. It is, in a "
"nutshell, an airtight suit of armour with servo-assisted joints and an on-"
"board control system. The outer skin is a flexible three-layer composite, "
"with outer layers consisting of nanotube-fullerene fabric, and an inner "
"layer of special polymer gel, mixed with Wolfram-Molybdene powder. When the "
"outer layer of the composite is burned, the gel evaporates instantly, "
"dissipating the heat, and the metal powder will create a cloud around the "
"damaged area, thus creating a local bloom effect that will consume much of "
"the energy.\n"
"\n"
"The inside consists of a thick layer of memory gel covered by an "
"electrically sensitive lining. The gel allows the suit to be fitted to a "
"range of heights and body shapes, so hopefully we shouldn't have to custom-"
"build every suit to fit one specific soldier. The inner lining is an "
"important part of the control system; it detects nerve impulses through the "
"wearer's skin, interprets these signals, and uses them to predict the "
"wearer's movements before they're made. This allows the suit to move "
"simultaneously with the body rather than resisting the user's movements.\n"
"\n"
"A useful side effect of the memory gel is that it can absorb explosive "
"force, providing better shelter to explosive effects than any of our "
"previous models. Because the suit is entirely sealed, it provides much "
"better protection against environmental hazards such as gas and is effective "
"at dissipating heat, although a wearer can still be roasted inside the suit "
"if he sits in flames long enough. The helmet has built-in sensors to detect "
"flashbangs and cushion the wearer against momentary spikes of light and "
"noise intended to disorient the enemy.\n"
"\n"
"I recommend we get this power armour onto the battlefield as soon as "
"possible. Some of the soldiers may have difficulties adjusting to the bulky "
"suit, but they'll be happy for the protection.\n"

"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma. This makes sense. It is their weapon of choice and "
"we would expect them to know how to protect against it. Because plasma "
"weaponry appears to have limited penetration capabilities, the armour is "
"able to disperse the heat before it can melt through the protective layers.\n"
"\n"
"The armour also performs pretty well against ordinary bullets and "
"explosives, although it's not very effective against incendiary devices or "
"flamethrowers. These weapons raise the atmospheric temperature around the "
"wearer so that there is no place to dump the heat, effectively roasting the "
"wearer inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll permit me, I'd like to raise a final issue with you, Commander. "
"One of my researchers has toyed with a personal laser project over the last "
"couple of months. While we were testing the alien armour, we allowed him to "
"experiment with it in his downtime and we were astonished by the results. "
"The relatively weak laser beam was hardly reduced as it passed through the "
"armor.\n"
"\n"
"I know that we've long believed that effective man-portable laser weaponry "
"is just a myth, but these suprise findings have reinvigorated my team. I'm "
"hearing all sorts of interesting proposals. This armour will seriously dent "
"our ability to use the aliens' plasma weaponry against them on the "
"battlefield. If we could use lasers to pack a reasonable punch into a hand-"
"held rifle, it could be the best response to their armor.\n"
"\n"
"Please give some thought to the laser weaponry ideas in your queue.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
"mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
"race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy "
"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "
"mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the "
"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing "
"open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will "
"still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "
"critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense "
"nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so "
"many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, "
"as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those "
"upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"Research Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 16 February 1958\n"
"\n"
"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full "
"extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to "
"examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the "
"discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn "
"their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
"communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
"and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
"given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
"there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking "
"EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is "
"another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war "
"with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
"that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
"PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
"extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
"perform up to its design spec."

"活的生命研究，可以使我们对它们的动机有更多的了解，同时或许有机会和它们交流，"

"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn "
"you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before "
"they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before "
"anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble "

"buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a "
"new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates "
"all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets "
"data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission "
"planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that "
"launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate "
"without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; "
"our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and "
"state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a "
"gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't "
"function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but "
"I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every "
"few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, "
"keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a "
"well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"
"absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "
"any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain "
"access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and "
"should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-"
"duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting "
"the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "
"tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains "
"nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to "
"destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick "
"and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over "
"the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
"countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
"start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
"attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
"aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air "
"Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
"batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. "
"Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-"
"mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in "
"acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a "
"hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
"miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
"study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened "
"is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other "
"incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its "
"target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply "
"need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some "
"old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our "
"results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
"engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This "
"is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an "
"airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless "
"of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on "
"the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but "
"in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics "
"suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the "
"numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has "
"agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no "
"cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage "
"any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack "
"the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting "
"our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of "
"the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to "
"completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage "
"them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or "
"later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
"designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
"longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a "
"follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
"while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
"enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
"effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"二战以后，飞弹越来越多，威力越来越大。而防御技术在21世纪初才开始发展。任何对"
"抗中攻击和防御，往往都是攻击者一直有优势。然而，在我们的脑海里，这并不能打破"
"异形的防御。\n"
"\n"
"就拿GEU部队在波恩用地对空飞弹打击异形飞船举例来说，当雷达锁定2架异形飞船的时"
"候，欧洲各地发射了40枚地对空飞弹，附近的地面部队发射了12-15枚肩式防空飞弹。\n"
"\n"
"战果如何？只有一枚击中目标，被击中的UFO在波恩缓慢着陆以后又马上顺利起飞。\n"
"\n"
"结论是显而易见的：异形的电子作战能力远远高于我们。不过，我们在PHALANX仔细研究"
"了那个仅有的战果，发现这不是运气问题。事实上，当UFO躲避其他攻击的时候，会有一"
"处弱点，而这枚飞弹正是通过这个弱点而锁死了目标。\n"
"\n"
"这说明异形对我们的飞弹并不是无懈可击。我们只需要最好的人选来做这个工作。成果"
"就是我们改进了一些旧的飞弹设计和全新的发射装置。我们的研究结果是有希望的。\n"
"\n"
"这套装置有4个联动发射器，打击目标的时候，4个会同时发射并互相协调。每一套装置"
"可以容纳20个AA51蝉式地对空飞弹。这是地球上最先进的导弹，上面的电子装备比一架"
"客机还多，不管敌机速度有多快都能锁定，没有其他同类型武器能够与之媲美。\n"
"\n"
"对付异形飞船，该飞弹命中机会还是很低。不过数量多的时候还是有效的。导弹和电子"
"套件当然是非常昂贵，如果要成功的攻击来袭的UFO，所需的资金远远超过我们的预算经"
"费。幸好，联合国同意从他们的战略石油储备中支付我们建设这个标准设施。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"如果基地有个飞弹发射仓，如何决定何时发射导弹是个值得注意的问题。是在UFO一靠近"
"基地进入导弹攻击范围就开始发射导弹，还是等UFO被确定为准备袭击基地的时候再发"
"射？这一决定全靠该基地指挥官。协助我们的航空机拦截UFO将有助于减轻我们飞行员的"
"一些压力，但根本无法完全掩盖我们发射导弹，尽管我们使用了最好的伪装。多次大规"
"模的发射将迟早暴露基地的位置。\n"
"\n"
"在基地遭到攻击的时候，飞弹发射仓应该不会是重要的目标。它只是是为了防止基地受"
"到袭击，如果敌人已经进入基地，那它应该不再有作用，除非敌人还有后续的进攻行"
"动。它可以作为一个诱人的目标来吸引敌人的注意，但是，如果在飞弹发射仓展开防"

"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "
"equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid "
"deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house "
"and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "
"could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-"
"injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced "
"facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has "
"available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai "
"hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific "
"bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better "
"prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the "
"coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and "
"contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to "
"completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of "
"Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected "
"to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We "
"are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and "
"regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself "
"through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical "
"nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. "
"Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full "
"health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury "
"counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. "
"Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military "
"sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes "
"and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at "
"the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford "
"the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous "
"electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for "
"treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to "
"be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in "
"a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be "
"obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; "
"convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery "
"must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic "
"upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a "
"negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to "
"kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is "
"relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their "
"primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the "
"Hospital immediately.\n"

"概况\n"
"\n"
"长官，战争将会非常可怕。为了治疗在战场上受重伤的人员，我们需要更先进的设备，"
"而不是一般民用或军用医院使用的那种。这一点是显而易见的，孟买的医院数百人不必"
"要的丧生，就是因为那里没有适当的设备可以治疗外星武器的等离子伤害。我们必须做"
"好更充分的准备。\n"
"\n"
"旧的PHALANX医务所设计严重不足，根本无法应付这场灾难。自从在1960年创造建医务所"
"以来他们从来没有更新过，那些设备根本派不上用处。到最后，我们只好自己重新设"
"计，幸好有纳瓦拉司令官和建设专家的帮忙。我真是不知道那些人对未知外星武器的伤"
"害是怎么预期的。\n"
"\n"
"现在我们的医务所设备是世界上最好的。我们治疗伤口特别是清理和再生烧焦的肌肉组"
"织有超前的技术。我们采用受伤肉体的自我再生技术来强化治疗，其中包括了特效药"
"品、电子神经和肌肉刺激，并使用纳米机器人直接进入伤口输液。从理论上讲，任何伤"
"员在六个星期内都能完全恢复。这还包括心理上的治疗。当然轻伤患者只需更少的时间"
"就能全愈。\n"
"\n"
"我们还可以做截肢和仿生手术。强大的人工肢体已经可以供应世界各地的部队，这包括"
"装甲躯干笼、电子眼和其他人工肢体。在医务所我们可以给我们的士兵安装这些部件，"
"来提高其作战效能，前提当然是我们能够负担起，这个手术的疗养时间是比较长的。\n"
"\n"
"医务所需要不间断的电力供应。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"每个有武装反应部队的基地都应建造医务所来治疗伤兵。如果没有PHALANX医务所，士兵"
"们将不得不去普通的医疗机构治疗，很有可能会导致永久丧失能力，甚至死亡。\n"
"\n"
"人工肢体移植提升的效果是显而易见的。这些手术只能给健康的人做，另外手术后需要"
"花很长时间来训练并疗养新的身体部件才能真正发挥作用。请记住躯体移植或更换电子"
"眼可能会对士气产生负面影响。\n"
"\n"
"在战术上，医务所不太会受到敌人重视。异形可能会试图杀害我们的伤员和破坏我们的"
"医疗设备，但这显然不太可能，有太多其他目标比医务所更重要。当然，如果我们受到"
"攻击，一名附近警卫应立即在医务所发出警告。\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "
"personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and "
"several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "
"effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of "
"uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/"
"important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage "
"space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate "
"shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural "
"sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "
"designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can "
"take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and "
"supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of "
"tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear "
"blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the "
"event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current "
"tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it "
"the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven "
"minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close "
"-- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they "
"will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to "
"participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most "
"likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the "
"extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as "
"effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range "
"is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further "
"installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "
"explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO "
"detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully "
"reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if "
"we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and "
"other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft "
"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "
"authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "
"labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "
"time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and "
"protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in "
"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "
"may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "
"protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility "
"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "
"of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort "
"getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets "

"production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on "
"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "
"assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the "
"world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines "
"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an "

"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "

"technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be "
"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "
"base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission "
"objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a "
"victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to "
"destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new "
"aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute "
"necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but "
"that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the "
"entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter "
"Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN "
"nuclear site register. At full capacity just one storage facility will be "
"containing the equivalent of nearly half a megaton of TNT. While this isn't "
"much compared to modern thermonuclear weapons, it's enough to turn the "
"entire base and everything inside to cinders in less than a second. It's "
"difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but under the wrong circumstances, it can "
"happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the "
"annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the "
"containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at "
"this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed "
"particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be "
"poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"I believe I've already stressed that this facility must be the most heavily-"
"defended building in any PHALANX base, taking priority even over the Command "
"Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would "
"be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap "
"at the Antimatter Storage.\n"
"\n"
"Although this facility will be essential to our continued success in this "
"war, it's going to be very expensive to build and operate due to the "
"advanced tech and materials required. It may be necessary to hold off on "
"building one until we're sure our budget can stretch that far.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, until we manage to build one of these facilities, we'll be "
"completely unable to store or use any recovered antimatter. We can't just "
"build up a pile of unstable, alien, possibly-damaged tanks of nuclear-level "
"explosive. Everything we find will have to be destroyed for safety.\n"

"rather than the exception. The current state of affairs, however, can only "
"be explained through the brutal history of the 21st century.\n"

"forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and "
"warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over "
"the years as a result.\n"
"\n"
"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-"
"East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. "
"The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several "
"years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim "
"promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military "
"invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily "
"ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did "
"nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China "
"annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to "
"disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day "
"invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the "
"Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could "
"even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from "
"the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades "
"to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold "
"War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese "
"territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to "
"nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under "
"a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the "
"country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become "
"increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of "
"world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps "
"became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the "
"army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country "
"to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not "
"approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often "
"referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It "
"saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, "
"and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul "
"and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six "
"50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the "
"civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it "
"was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More "
"than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on "
"15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale "

"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but "
"it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops "
"are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-"
"old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due "
"to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most "
"of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with "
"one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat "
"poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "
"state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world "
"superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister "
"Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While "
"the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about "
"who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own "
"problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, "
"which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. "
"Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya "
"could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it "
"did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the "
"Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in "
"Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter "
"conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power "
"plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, "
"safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from "
"enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian "
"plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new "
"type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of "
"the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and "
"from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear "
"revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted "
"element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's "
"waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The "
"Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission "
"became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the "
"world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the "
"example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power "
"generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The "
"nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and "
"commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the "
"country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether "
"under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat "
"antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it "
"does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Oceania:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the "
"countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into "
"the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when "
"joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and "
"burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own "
"parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, "
"they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in "
"military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had "
"trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the "
"Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian "
"military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the "
"country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several "
"South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the "
"Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the "
"surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated "
"the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the "
"country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines "
"were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless "
"parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small "
"regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the "
"vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the "
"Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one "
"great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the "
"Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships "
"passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was "
"free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. "
"Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth "
"seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their "
"full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of "
"Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-"
"Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and "
"Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still "
"can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its "
"own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is "
"minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves "
"only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, "
"it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art "
"equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to "
"combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "
"budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some "
"new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the "
"opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but "
"after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into "
"obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its "
"commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their "
"aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk "
"couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's "
"slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the "
"country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in "
"2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was "
"dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown "
"into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered "
"reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The "
"existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter "
"of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The "
"massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them "
"secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on "
"television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of "
"their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap "
"of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things "
"got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, "
"Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it "
"began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session "
"continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with "
"lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien "
"invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. "
"It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in "
"the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, "
"however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one "
"could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the "
"Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as "
"well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned "
"missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that "
"counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital "
"defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear "
"missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish "
"projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one "
"aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, "
"designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an "
"invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it "
"to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part "
"of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, "
"known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the "
"world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a "
"hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to "
"resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was "
"tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were "
"dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the "
"secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support "
"and the men it needed to go to war.\n"
"\n"
"All it lacked was a leader."

"Our study on antimatter is complete, Commander, and we're ready to present "
"our results. I'm afraid the news is mostly bad.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of things the aliens know that we don't. Nowhere is this "
"more clear in their widespread use of antimatter. It seems to be plentiful "
"for them, at least plentiful enough to send out UFO after UFO to Earth, "
"burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into antimatter, on the "
"other hand . . .\n"
"\n"
"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of "
"anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near "
"Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not long after, another "
"lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come slowly forward over the "
"years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by "
"the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
"availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with "
"every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
"antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
"gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a "
"UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over the "
"past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in "
"the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom "
"line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they "
"create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to "
"do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts "
"will be fruitless.\n"
"\n"
"Our only major successes have come from studying how the aliens store their "
"antimatter. We're confident we can employ the same magnetic storage "
"techniques, creating special facilities for safely storing antimatter. I've "
"sent you a set of blueprints in a separate message to peruse at your "
"convenience. We've also designed antimatter fuel tanks that should fit in "
"our interceptors given some major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full "
"understanding of the alien engines before we can begin designing a new "
"aircraft propulsion system.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If "
"we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering "
"it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may "
"have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we "

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures in the device are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, "
"very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all "
"of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of "
"our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our "
"ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. "
"Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "
"learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign "
"language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and "
"instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign "
"language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on "
"trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been "
"easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical "
"encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The "
"casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to "
"have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or "
"even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical "
"differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This "
"indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared "
"consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it "
"merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from "
"our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share "
"one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means "
"of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an "
"indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and "
"breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even "
"specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens "
"will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various "
"species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate "
"with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign "
"language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep "
"conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own "
"body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain "
"really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
"part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
"homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission "
"to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to "
"distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to "
"tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would "
"like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more "
"effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a "
"healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to "
"maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would "
"be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. "
"It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting "
"a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to "
"answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the "
"ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal "
"-- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have "
"gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our "
"most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "
"thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then "
"channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO "
"extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing "
"it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system "
"continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to "
"keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used "
"to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If "
"a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a "
"gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the "
"Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as "
"possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to "
"jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on "
"the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of "
"the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion "
"represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is "
"that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, "
"regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation "
"detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be "
"impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, "
"every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at "
"high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is "
"quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a "
"memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a "
"more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a "
"more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher "
"than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far "
"more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components "
"and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this "
"craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the "
"individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve "
"deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to "
"counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I "
"can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us "
"in the fight for Earth.\n"

"\n"
"--燃料箱非常非常小，只有几克重量，但即使这样找到的时候还是差一点吓到我。如果"
"其中的一个燃料箱发生反应或泄漏，哪怕只有十分之三克的反物质反应，威力就会超过"
"广岛原子弹。当然，燃料箱的外部结构和其所在机身位置都有一定的防护设备，但它们"
"并不完美。被直接击中的燃料箱仍有可能引起爆炸。大部分的爆炸对UFO的强硬结构都构"
"不成危险，但任何爆炸对我们自己来说是一个极端的危险。唯一可取的是，质子反质子"
"湮灭不存在放射性污染。\n"
"\n"
"--人类的探测设备几乎很难发现UFO。这是由于UFO的外部材料非常有效地吸收各种辐"
"射。最幸运的发现是，被动式红外和伽马辐射检测都还有效，因为发动机产生的能量太"
"大了。\n"
"\n"
"--由于船体材料过于沉重，升降翼采用了和机身不同的超薄材料。飞船高速飞行只需要"
"很小的升降翼。这些材料本身相当惊人，由部分金属和塑料聚合物组成。它的职能作为"
"一个记忆合金，可以'记住'至少有两个指定的形状，在冷的时候，缩小成一个更紧凑的"
"形式，在热的时候自动伸展成一种更合适的飞行状态。它比任何已知的地球上物质（除"
"纯碳纳米管以外）都坚固，而且很轻巧。对它作更多的研究无疑是很有必要的。\n"
"\n"
"有了这些事实，我们现在可以开始分析UFO的不同部件的作用了。我建议，我们的工程师"
"应马上开始拆解零件。谁知道我们又会发现什么更惊人的东西？\n"
"\n"
"对UFO很值得做更多的研究。我认为，我们可以更深入地钻研它的功能，或许能获得一些"
"它如何运作的知识。我会尽快寄给您有关的研究草案。\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "
"a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take "
"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"

"Commander: The human prisoners in our Containment unit exhibit the very same "

"\n"
"We've run and re-run examinations and blood tests on these people ad "

"replicate like a virus when placed in an uninfected human body and rapidly "
"takes over, enslaving the victim to the alien hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"These subjects run the gamut of the human race; there seems to be no "

"Eisenhower, our Director of Administration. He's been away on business to "

"positive. We don't know when or how he was subverted or if he even joined "

"here in DivBio. My assistant has been jumping at shadows all day.\n"

"The most striking characteristic we've seen of the invasion is that the "
"aliens have been harvesting human biomass, sometimes even whole people, for "
"their own nebulous purposes. They do this in a rather gruesome manner that "
"shows no respect for life; they cut up human beings as if butchering cattle, "
"and their Bloodspiders will simply dissect someone on the spot for a "
"particularly interesting organ or a pint of blood. It is utterly, amorally "
"practical.\n"
"\n"
"We can only assume that they use the samples they're gathering in some kind "
"of research program, studies into our physiology and perhaps our psychology "
"and culture as well. We don't know the reasons behind this, but it's an "
"interesting point. They are trying to learn something about us, and they "
"don't care how we feel about it. To them, we're merely objects to be "
"studied.\n"
"\n"
"Of further interest are their main targets. Until recently alien activity "
"reports came almost exclusively from high-density population centres with "
"easy landing access for UFOs, which ties in with the general objective of "
"capturing human research material. However, as of late the focus of the "
"campaign seems to have shifted or narrowed. Activity around hospitals, blood "
"banks and bio-research laboratories has been noticed more and more "
"frequently in addition to the usual raids on population centres. The "
"activity has ranged from low-key infiltration for unknown purposes up to "
"full-scale assaults on high-security labs. We're not sure yet what this "
"shift could mean, but we are making recommendations to the UN to sharpen "
"security in these facilities and arm local forces to stand up to alien "
"attack. We've marked up a list of high-risk targets for rapid police "
"response and are distributing handbooks on anti-alien tactics. More "
"investigation into the change of targets is underway.\n"
"\n"
"As always, there is a lot more alien activity going on outside of our "
"detection range which goes unreported by civilian authorities. DivIntel is "
"currently experimenting with new ways of reporting and responding to alien "
"activity as well as better networking between UN nations to get valid "
"information to PHALANX faster, all of which are direct results of our "
"research into the aliens' strategy. We expect that these techniques will "
"allow us to catch an estimated 10% of alien activity (out of total estimated "
"activity on Earth) that would have previously gone unreported.\n"
"\n"
"We've also looked into how UFOs are getting to and from Earth, despite our "
"problems finding and tracking the elusive larger craft we've observed. After "
"reviewing radar, lidar and video recordings made from observatories on the "
"planet surface, we now believe the larger UFOs to be some manner of aircraft "
"carrier; a simple FTL-equipped base ship ferrying smaller UFOs to and from "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"This craft is of extreme importance and we must find some way to shoot it "
"down from orbit if we can. We should keep a close guard, Commander.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Let me begin by stating a few ugly realities.\n"
"\n"
"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the "
"initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, "
"and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of "
"volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which "
"are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly "
"exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an "
"instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid "
"does come under attack, comms between PHALANX Command Centres and assets in "
"the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying "
"items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is "
"nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer "
"under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at "
"all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've "
"fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-"
"planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are "
"years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane "
"in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at "
"our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are "
"nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too "
"destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever "
"managed to score a hit. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into "
"extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that "
"has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're "
"going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, "
"but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are "
"starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is "
"to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency "
"to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our "
"extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base "
"colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with "
"enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library "
"of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns "
"into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. "
"We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to "
"lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built "
"into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in "
"front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on "
"the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling "
"block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in "
"order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its "
"own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the "
"UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- "
"to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, "
"heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely "
"necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"

"serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy "
"assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and "
"light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "
"It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien "
"positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from "
"all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault "
"weapon.\n"
"\n"
"It should be a prime candidate for any soldier with assault weapons "
"training.\n"

"英国的SA－3000GPG俗称大不列颠机枪是一种使用滚筒弹夹的机关枪，已经在世界各地服"

"战场上发挥作用，有两支固定脚架。\n"
"\n"
"GPG普通型在各步兵部队使用得很广泛。它没有使用和大多数机枪一样的不可散式弹链，"
"而使用的是滚筒弹夹。这限制了连发频率，但也增加了灵活性。作为机枪它的装弹速度"
"是一流的，每个弹夹有100发子弹。虽然这款机关枪是大型武器，但相对而言体积和重量"
"都比较小。\n"
"\n"
"枪体还有反冲补偿和减震系统，这有助于提高准确度，但精度还是无法和狙击步枪相"
"比。坚固的设计和简单的构造使它成为世界上最可靠的机枪。在孟买的表现也令人满"
"意，给部队提供了非常有效的压制火力，甚至在某些地形牵制了异形的小分队。\n"
"\n"
"GPG的弹药是4.7毫米无壳穿甲弹，和我们使用的AR－80突击步枪一样。不过因为点火装"

"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-"
"based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the "
"shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-"
"designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic molecules "
"before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced regularly, but we've designed the system to "
"make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during "
"the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in "
"order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production, since more refining and balancing is required for real-world "
"combat. I've submitted new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas "
"we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "

"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "

"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire high-"
"explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as "
"light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience "
"has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the "
"handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and "
"there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "
"another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been "
"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel and are fin-stabilised in flight. Surprisingly "
"they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an "
"impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable "
"in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, "
"they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one "
"good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This is a 120mm solid-fuel rocket fitted with an incendiary warhead. It is "
"fired electronically by a spark igniter inside the launcher's barrel. The "
"fuel is highly stable and resists concussion and heat, though it can cook "
"off if exposed to high temperatures for a significant period of time. The "
"warhead itself can spill its contents if damaged, but the thermite mix will "
"not ignite unless exposed to a very high-temperature flame.\n"
"\n"
"Incendiary rockets are area-denial weapons, covering a patch of ground with "
"very hot flames that are almost impossible to extinguish. The compound "
"itself is a modification of a mixture that has been in use since World War "
"II; thermite, barium nitrate, sulphur and binding agent.\n"
"\n"
"Because it carries no onboard electronics, the rocket is impervious to EMP "
"and electronic jamming. All high-tech aiming is done at the launcher. "
"Therefore a properly-aimed rocket will arrive at its target regardless of "
"anything that might happen during flight.\n"
"\n"
"The rocket is meant to be loaded into an HPML Rocket Launcher.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All soldiers equipped with rocket launchers should carry at least one reload "
"whenever they go out in the field. Two or more are strongly recommended. It "
"is not advisable to send our troops into combat without sufficient "
"ammunition.\n"

"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"

"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping "
"power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It is one of "
"the heaviest and most cumbersome rifles one might legitimately call a rifle, "
"but in the hands of a trained specialist it is extraordinarily accurate.\n"

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade "
"materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and "
"have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd "
"figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we "
"ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape "
"into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade "
"with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be "
"used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half "
"during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until "
"we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a "
"function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands "
"during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, "
"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "
"they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat "
"knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's "
"sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two "
"weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in "
"lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a "
"sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee "
"combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
"troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of "
"the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a "
"soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses "
"or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the "
"feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to "
"make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, "
"then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, "
"one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten "
"sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The "
"backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special "
"fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, "
"creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a "
"fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts "
"horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees "
"celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it "
"leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding "
"area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly "
"safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"
"\n"
"The ADA 22's main drawbacks are its short range and its complex internals, "
"which are difficult to repair. However, our experienced technicians should "
"have no problem doing maintenance on this model.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this flamethrower the classification CRC-FL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-FL is a close-range weapon; the operator needs to be fast in order "
"to get into weapons range and unleash as much hell as possible. It is also a "
"rather weighty weapon despite its relatively slim design. Strength as well "
"as speed is required to wield it effectively.\n"

"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "

"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of "

"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was "
"first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or "
"metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th "
"century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made "
"them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: "
"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of "

"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"Incendiary grenades are area-denial weapons, covering a large stretch of "
"ground with very hot flames that are almost impossible to extinguish. Once "
"thrown, the body of the grenade explodes, spreading the incendiary compound "
"over the surrounding area -- and anyone unlucky enough to be inside the area "
"of effect. The compound itself is a modification of a mixture that has been "
"in use since World War II; thermite, barium nitrate, sulphur and binding "
"agent. The grenade's delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and "
"then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It "
"will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"The standard American M71 grenade consists of a core of C8 explosive, an "
"inner layer of incendiary agent, and an outer plastic casing that provides "
"no fragmentation but more importantly doesn't slow down or otherwise impede "
"the delivery of the payload over a large area. The M71's casing is a smooth "
"cylinder shape, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to make "
"it easier to roll across various surfaces.\n"
"\n"
"Like all hand grenades, their range is limited, but they can be an essential "
"tool for achieving control of the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Incendiary grenades are tactical weapons that should be used to contain or "
"herd the enemy into disadvantageous ground. They cannot be thrown very far, "
"but they can serve to block off escape routes, to flush out rooms, or simply "
"to catch the enemy in a blazing inferno.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in "
"the area of effect, as the effect of the thermate cocktail on human tissue "
"is a particular public relations nightmare. In such situations the use of "
"lethal grenades is strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given "
"preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be "
"equipped with at least one grenade of some variety -- be it an incendiary "
"grenade, frag grenade, flashbang or other -- in case the need should arise. "
"Two or more are strongly recommended.\n"

"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes. When fired in Impact mode, the grenades will "
"explode as soon as they hit something -- a wall or the target. They'll also "
"explode the moment they reach their target destination, a nice way to ensure "
"the grenade will explode near to where the soldier is aiming it.\n"
"\n"
"But it also has a Timer mode. When fired this way, the grenades will "
"detonate several seconds after leaving the barrel regardless of what happens "
"in those seconds. This is great for bouncing a grenade around a corner or "
"firing a long shot, but it is harder to be precise.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "

"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "

"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "

"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "

"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most "
"of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing "
"them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty "
"inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this "
"penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire "

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"
"\n"
"Given the unusual grip, we haven't drawn up specs for producing these things "
"in-house. You'll only be able to use what you can collect on the battlefield "
"for now, but we'll continue to brainstorm ideas for how to incorporate this "
"technology into our own weaponry.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this "
"message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working "
"on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm "
"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol that won't be rendered completely ineffective by alien armour.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "
"fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste "
"gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down "
"even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the "
"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"
"strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a "
"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Still, the laser will "
"burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "
"which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses "
"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "
"other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't "
"powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, its "
"range is quite impressive indeed for a handgun and it can fire continuously "
"for minutes without reloading.\n"

"and weight considerably compared to the stun rod, putting the electrolaser "
"firmly in the Heavy Weapons category. Like all laser-based weapons it's "
"affected by rain, fog, smoke and other conditions that thicken the air or "
"release particles into it. Like all electric weapons, firing at airborne "
"targets will produce limited results, unless they're close enough to an "
"earthed object to allow the electricity to arc between them. In addition, "
"any electrolaser needs the right kind of atmosphere to be able to create a "

"Another, more practical issue is the power unit. We couldn't quite achieve "
"the desired power output profile using our standard deuterium-fluoride "
"cartridges, so we've had to make adjustments to the ammunition package "
"itself. I'm afraid this means that ammunition for the electrolaser is NOT "
"interchangeable with ammunition for our regular laser weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, no matter what the drawbacks might be, performance is light-years "
"ahead of Dr. Connor's stun rod. I highly recommend we replace all stun rods "

"Technical Specifications: Medikit\n"
"\n"
"CLASSIFIED LEVEL YELLOW\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Medikits come with three prepared treatment capabilities. Apply First Aid "
"will treat a soldier's wounds, stemming the blood loss of a wound in an "
"effort to keep them alive. It will restore a small amount of health, but "
"soldiers will need to recover back at base.\n"
"\n"
"Stimulants can be used to revive a soldier who has fallen unconcious as a "
"result of being stunned or gassed.\n"
"\n"
"Antipsychotics will provide an injection of endorphins. Many desperate "
"commanders have found it useful to boost morale during highly stressful "
"engagements."

"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"在过去的战争中，紧急救护有很多局限性。士兵往往看到其他人受伤也只能继续战斗，"
"没有其他更多的选择，只能期望医务人员能及时赶到，最多也只能对小伤口做简单的包"
"扎。受伤的士兵在这种情况及时存活下来，也会在医务所休息好几周甚至好几个月才能"
"再次返回战场。\n"
"\n"
"自第二次世界大战以后，急救技术得到了很快的发展。在对士兵作简单培训以后，很多"
"简单的医疗措施和设备都能及时在战场上发挥作用了。这就是现代急救包的效用。\n"
"\n"
"每个急救包都有一台微型电脑，可以用来进行X光和超声波检查。同时还可以分析心电图"
"和脑电波，测量血压和心率，甚至还可以根据士兵的个人资料（每个士兵手臂都植有一"
"个储存芯片）来估算他的战斗力。所有这些信息可以显示成小全息图像或直接连接士兵"
"的头盔信息系统。与此同时急救包还配备了各种药品和一些无菌手术工具以及纳米机器"
"人，必要时可以给伤员作紧急手术。\n"
"\n"
"在30年前，越南的研究人员第一次成功的把医疗纳米机器人用于临床手术。今天，医学"
"技术已经发展到不可思议的地步。纳米机器人的大小只有几个微米，可以自由的在人体"
"内活动。他们可以给伤口消毒，可以缝合破裂的动脉，可以结扎出血的微动脉，可以修"
"复肠胃穿刺，可以移除坏死组织甚至还可以修复损伤的神经。一旦电池耗尽它们就会自"
"动分解到血液里。它们的存活时间很短，往往不会超过10-15秒，所以对于重伤员来说它"
"们不是很有效。急救包一般配备两个剂量以上的纳米机器人。不管多少数量的纳米机器"
"人都不会对人体造成任何不良影响。\n"
"\n"
"这项技术对于外科手术来说是最重要的创造发明。它可以让受伤的士兵发上恢复。不过"
"要注意的是，如果受伤的是重要器官或其他等等严重的情况，急救包也只能提供必要的"
"急救处理手段，他并不能完全代替真正的手术室。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"我们所有的士兵都已通过急救训练。理论上每个士兵都应该携带一个急救包以备万一，"
"但实际情况下，我们士兵的负重是有限的。士兵一旦受伤，就应该立即对主要伤口作紧"
"急处理，以防止并发症等风险，如果伤者还能移动，那应该立即撤出火线，找一处安全"
"的地方由他人协助进行仔细的治疗。\n"
"\n"
"急救包的药品还有用于昏迷士兵的清醒剂。当然急救包的使用都是要靠其他人，伤者自"
"身无法对自己使用。担负医疗员角色的士兵需要靠近伤者才能治疗，这一般都很危险，"
"请注意火力掩护，在尽可能的情况下治疗最好远离火线。\n"
"\n"
"一旦受伤的士兵能活着返回基地，我们的医疗小组将接管治疗。基本上PHALANX医务所可"
"以治愈任何伤者，这里我们可以保证做到这一点。\n"

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff "
"into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs "
"between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost "
"certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will "
"appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the "
"control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual "
"for human use. Our soldiers will now be able to employ the plasma pistol in "
"a combat scenario as they would any other weapon.\n"

"Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the "
"news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate. It can't be thrown effectively because "
"its chances of achieving a seal are very low. Planting one by hand has a "
"much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while "
"wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. "
"All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before "
"it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of "
"things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own "
"lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, "
"sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a "

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "
"with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

"告诉你，手枪是手枪，步枪是步枪。手枪体积小主要是个人自卫武器。而步枪是战争武"
"器。这种差距是很大的。\n"
"\n"
"等离子步枪的威力比等离子手枪大20％，可以击透重型装甲。步枪等离子弹的外裹塑料"
"也厚于手枪，射出80米后才会开始解体。这是等离子步枪的最大射程，但足以应付城市"
"里的战斗。由于等离子弹的质量变大了，外界风力影响也就不是那么重要了，这使得等"
"离子步枪的精度也大大提高了不少。\n"
"\n"

"The Encased Plasma Ammo is essentially a shape charge miniaturized to fit "

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared "
"a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
"rifle, but an unusual one. Like a machine gun, it is designed to saturate a "
"target with projectiles, but it takes this concept much further. It vomits "
"out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
"easily tear apart a target.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, "
"hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute "
"into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for "
"as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike "
"bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to "
"target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low "
"in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing. They are easily "
"knocked off course for the same reason, but so many needles are put down "
"range that even distant shots are likely to make some contact with the "
"enemy.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
"electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
"coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too "
"energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made "
"it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We "
"may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research. I've "
"put a new research proposal in your queue along these lines.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler's electromagnet array makes it much heavier than the average "
"rifle, which could reduce the effectiveness of some of our troops. But given "
"its deadly power, I'm sure more than a few of our boys will gladly shed some "
"other equipment to carry the Needler into battle.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "
"needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious "
"casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler "
"is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short "
"range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. "
"It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms "
"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the "
"most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first "
"prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese "
"government. Production models were only trickling into government units by "
"the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to "
"respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew "
"through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version "
"of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with "
"aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally "
"through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round "
"at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of "
"SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next "
"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "
"the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly "
"50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known "

"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very "

"\n"

"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 8-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows repeated shots without losing "
"control.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is not as effective at very great distance, but for a PHALANX squad's "
"typical short-range skirmishing, this should not become a problem.\n"
"\n"
"The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. "
"Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than "
"any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1 should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; it is too unwieldy to fire off quick snap shots with any accuracy. "
"Marksmen should assume a crouched firing position for extra stability "
"whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can "
"be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been "
"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "
"protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide "

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user. The stun rod is "
"more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. "
"Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"

"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. "
"Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious "
"about this war.\n"

"长官，我的方法奏效了。我想，我们已经成功地破解了神秘的粒子束武器的核心秘密。"
"这里是我的总结报告。\n"
"\n"
"单兵粒子束武器的出现使战斗更为困难。在一开始的时候，我们根本不知道异形拥有这"
"么先进的技术，我们也不知道为什么它们一开始不使用这种武器。异形的动机和战略对"
"我们来说还是一个未知数。不过，我想说的是这种武器将会改变一切。\n"
"\n"
"你必须明白在这份报告里我并不是在谈论具体的粒子束武器装备。正如我先前提交的报"
"告中所说的，这些粒子束武器本身自己只不过是一个金属外壳外加一些磁铁和静电反射"
"镜。真正的秘密就在一个像我拳头大小的空间里，就是我们以前所认为的“弹夹”。实际"
"上是令人难以置信的神奇。\n"
"\n"
"每个弹夹其实是一个微型同步粒子加速器，我们根本无法想象它们是如何建造它的。该"
"加速器的加速管道直径略小于弹夹的直径。原子粒子在加速到一定速度以后，内部的磁"
"场矩阵会自动重新排列，然后这些粒子就会被约束在一起形成粒子光束。\n"
"\n"
"长官，这么复杂的微型加速器估计在我有生之年是造不出来的。全地球现在也没有这项"
"技术。粒子束武器的结构很简单，但其核心技术我们根本无法理解和学习。如果我们要"
"真正使用这些粒子束武器，那我们就必须使用外星弹药。更糟糕的是，这些微型加速器"
"的使用寿命好像很短，只用了几次就会开始发生故障。我们的弹药供应将会极不稳定，"
"一切都取决于我们能从战场上缴获多少弹夹。\n"
"\n"
"我无法告诉你为什么这种武器在战争开始的时候没有出现。外星战争机器明显要优于我"
"们好几个数量级。它们的技术更先进，它们有更多的士兵和更好的飞机，但它们至今也"
"只是和我们缠斗。这令人感到困惑。但是，任何一个优秀的士兵都会告诉你，“为什"
"么”并不重要。这些决策上的失误我们一定要加以利用。\n"
"\n"
"我们需要尽快升级我们所有的部队，长官。我们一定要在它们开始认真对待这场战争之"

"孟买事件让我们清楚的认识到他们的技术是如此的先进。英联邦军队根本对它们构成不"
"了威胁，他们损失了三个营才只是让异形停止了脚步。PHALANX要获得胜利必须使用人类"
"技术最高的产品。\n"

"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他"
"对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能"
"力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"英国的SA－3000GPG俗称大不列颠机枪是一种使用滚筒弹夹的机关枪，已经在世界各地服"
"役16年了。最早开始于2068年，它就作为步兵连的火力支援或直升机的地面支援武器在"
"战场上发挥作用，有两支固定脚架。\n"
"\n"
"GPG普通型在各步兵部队使用得很广泛。它没有使用和大多数机枪一样的不可散式弹链，"
"而使用的是滚筒弹夹。这限制了连发频率，但也增加了灵活性。作为机枪它的装弹速度"
"是一流的，每个弹夹有100发子弹。虽然这款机关枪是大型武器，但相对而言体积和重量"
"都比较小。\n"
"\n"
"枪体还有反冲补偿和减震系统，这有助于提高准确度，但精度还是无法和狙击步枪相"
"比。坚固的设计和简单的构造使它成为世界上最可靠的机枪。在孟买的表现也令人满"
"意，给部队提供了非常有效的压制火力，甚至在某些地形牵制了异形的小分队。\n"
"\n"
"GPG的弹药是4.7毫米无壳穿甲弹，和我们使用的AR－80突击步枪一样。不过因为点火装"
"置的缘故机枪弹和步枪弹之间无法混用。\n"
"\n"
"GPG是机枪武器里最出色的机关枪。我们的军队需要这种能够提供大量火力的武器。\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX使用的是MG12型GPG。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"MG12将是控制战场最重要的武器。它可以建立移动火力点，压制敌人的攻击和牵制敌人"

#~ "This is an extremely urgent report, please believe me when I say it "
#~ "cannot wait for anything.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I've found some disturbing new information during our continued research "
#~ "into the XVI organism. I have reason to believe that XVI may be an even "
#~ "larger part of the alien plan than we first suspected.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "First, some background. During our initial analyses of the aliens' "
#~ "cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA "
#~ "replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We "
#~ "initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to "
#~ "appear with unerring regularity. The same result, again and again; every "
#~ "time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have "
#~ "difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. It didn't make "
#~ "any sense until our recent discovery of the XVI infection in civilian "
#~ "people. I immediately suspected a correlation but wanted to wait until I "
#~ "could prove it, and since then I've spent most of my off hours studying "
#~ "the problem. Now I believe I've found the cause -- XVI itself.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I've determined that all the aliens carry their own versions of this same "
#~ "micro-organic infection. There are differences to account for the "
#~ "different bodies and blood types -- some of these varieties don't appear "
#~ "to live in blood at all -- but it is unmistakably the same thing. We can "
#~ "only assume that the different strands of the infection were engineered "
#~ "to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Since all the alien species carry a unique strand of the infection, I've "
#~ "decided to modify our naming conventions slightly, giving individual XVI "
#~ "strands alphabetical designations after the source in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Humans have XVI-H, Tamans have XVI-T, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The organism's function is not readily apparent in these aliens since we "
#~ "have no uninfected control specimens against which we can measure the "
#~ "effect. However, given this information, we have to conclude that XVI is "
#~ "more than simply a bio-weapon against humanity. It may even be used in a "
#~ "similar way -- an enslavement device suppressing individual thought and "
#~ "linking the subject into the group mind, whether there is a group or not. "
#~ "Perhaps the aliens that are sent to Earth are all members of some sort of "
#~ "slave soldier caste, or even prisoners forced to fight, like the Red "
#~ "Army's convict battalions in World War 2. At this point we can barely "
#~ "begin to speculate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I think we should pursue aggressive investigation into XVI so "
#~ "that we can find the truth behind some of these mysteries. We have to "
#~ "determine the true purpose of this organism, what it means to the war and "
#~ "to us as a species. XVI-H is possibly the biggest threat we've ever "
#~ "faced.\n"

#~ "New information has come to light during the last batch of autopsies you "
#~ "requested. Our reports stand, but we've discovered a commonality that may "
#~ "give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we "
#~ "encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due "
#~ "to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human "
#~ "error, but the problem has continued to appear with surprising "
#~ "regularity. The same result, again and again; every time we run a sample "
#~ "that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have difficulty extracting a "
#~ "single uncontaminated sequence. I spent some of my off hours studying the "
#~ "problem, and I believe I've found the cause.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in "
#~ "our blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences "
#~ "can be found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has "
#~ "confirmed that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species "
#~ "we've recovered. The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular "
#~ "organism present in huge numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are "
#~ "several versions of it, one for each species of alien, and they all share "
#~ "remarkable DNA similarities. Interestingly, although these organisms all "
#~ "have an identical number of chromosomes, none of them can survive in a "
#~ "body that is not a member of its source species. Also curious is the fact "
#~ "that there are absolutely no variations in DNA between organisms of the "
#~ "same version. This leads us to believe that the different versions may "
#~ "have been engineered -- wholly or in part -- to suit the individual "
#~ "species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
#~ "infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run "
#~ "tests on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control "
#~ "specimens. The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative "
#~ "effects -- or positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's "
#~ "presence. They are essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. "
#~ "Since the organism requires a living host for its own survival, it seems "
#~ "to be either a parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved "
#~ "benefits.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or "
#~ "XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is "
#~ "far more complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates "
#~ "exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien "
#~ "species carries a unique strand of the infection, we have given them "
#~ "alphabetical designations after the source species in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the "
#~ "only thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together "
#~ "physically. We can only assume that new strands of the infection were "
#~ "engineered to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When "
#~ "injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have "
#~ "observed the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. "
#~ "Unexpectedly, however, any trace of the infection was subsequently "
#~ "annihilated by standard human T cells. The organism was unable to "
#~ "deactivate our immune system in order to take root.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our "
#~ "soldiers on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep "
#~ "you updated about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our "
#~ "personnel is in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine "
#~ "procedures will be maintained throughout the lab.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "根据孟买和其他受灾城市得到的数据显示异形似乎喜欢在人口密集的地区活动。这说"
#~ "明大多数战斗都是巷战。为此神剑计划专门挑选了近距离作战的高性能武器。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "散弹枪最早出现于两个世纪以前的意大利，现在最新式的是罗西AAA半自动散弹枪，"
#~ "专门供特种部队和反恐部队使用。它采用了独特的设计技术，其中最令人印象深刻的"
#~ "是枪管设计，在扳机前部有一个装置可以改变枪管的滑膛线。有了这个装置，罗西"
#~ "AAA散弹枪可以在十分之一秒内就可以改变射击模式，可以根据弹药调整枪管的长"
#~ "度。这项技术使得罗西AAA可以随意改变攻击方式。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "军事上最常用的是12毫米中心底火式散弹。每发子弹出膛后会分裂成利箭向前方散"
#~ "开，穿甲能力很不错，杀伤性之高也令人印象深刻。其缺点是容易受风或其他因素的"

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided "
#~ "to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice "
#~ "of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
#~ "dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even "
#~ "got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two "
#~ "surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in "
#~ "government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig "
#~ "out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I "
#~ "can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm "
#~ "doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up "
#~ "to the task.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to "
#~ "persuade our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think "
#~ "you'll like it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
#~ "aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
#~ "cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
#~ "transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular "
#~ "alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due "
#~ "to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird "
#~ "with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer "
#~ "moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability "
#~ "across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the "
#~ "lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, "
#~ "however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for "
#~ "civilian applications.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
#~ "1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes "
#~ "a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of "
#~ "emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, "
#~ "which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile "
#~ "racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight "
#~ "characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses "
#~ "for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small "
#~ "battlefield vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as "
#~ "the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than "
#~ "any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to "
#~ "threats all over the world.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
#~ "deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
#~ "respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
#~ "recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity "
#~ "and to recover downed alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers "
#~ "will immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining "
#~ "troops will secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over "
#~ "and ensure delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. "
#~ "This is important because attempted looting of items left on the "
#~ "battlefield may become a problem in densely-populated regions. We can't "
#~ "afford to lose valuable alien technology because some idiot feels the "

#~ "的能量和控制都是直接来自于电刺激。所需要的电力由消化有机物产生的，并储存在"
#~ "位于肺部下面的一个有点像鳗鱼状的器官里。整个胸腔有丰富的骨架来保护内脏，骨"
#~ "架外就是绿色皮革。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "它的眼睛里布满了手术植入的镜片，用来加强Ortnok本身就已经很好的视觉系统，使"

#~ "的鼻子很小，在讨论会上我们认为它的嗅觉器官基本已经退化。\n"

#~ "根据我们的分析，我们得出的结论有以下几点：\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-大脑和原始人差不多，不会比直立人强，不过作为一个听从命令的士兵这就已经足"
#~ "够了。Ortnok在战场上不会有什么战术可言。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-三指手可以携带和使用各种各样的武器设备。Ortnok往往会配备大型武器，这样才"
#~ "比较符合他们的身材。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-Ortnok很强状很危险。身体结构增强了他们的自然耐力，使他们很难被打倒。建议"
#~ "是用穿甲弹或燃烧类武器。用白刃、激光或爆炸类武器来对付它，效果会有所降"
#~ "低。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "-所有Ortnok的尸体我们都没发现有繁殖器官。从腹股沟周围的手术疤痕推测，我们"
#~ "认为他们可能因为某些理由作了绝育手术。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "在战斗中，Ortnok似乎是一种用于火力支援的重型步兵。他们对复杂的武器不是特别"
#~ "的精确，他们通常采用密集火力来压制对手，对PHALANX小队来说危险性很高。"
#~ "Ortnok似乎没有其他专业能力，在我们的现场摄像记录里他们从未使用过复杂机械，"

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
#~ "technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
#~ "combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
#~ "battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and "
#~ "return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's "
#~ "combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, "
#~ "though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th "
#~ "century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in "
#~ "World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through "
#~ "WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, "
#~ "kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only "
#~ "by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced "
#~ "types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern "
#~ "weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and "
#~ "its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
#~ "PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in "
#~ "the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every "
#~ "attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers "
#~ "at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in "
#~ "2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device "
#~ "called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds "
#~ "of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-"
#~ "production of spider silk.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
#~ "came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
#~ "Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar "
#~ "vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra "
#~ "high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
#~ "flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel "
#~ "and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between "
#~ "300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete "
#~ "after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the "
#~ "new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the "
#~ "world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so "
#~ "effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on "
#~ "the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further "
#~ "protect vital areas.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight "
#~ "compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers "
#~ "required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly "
#~ "distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than "
#~ "experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while "
#~ "preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they "
#~ "are sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered "
#~ "the basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some "
#~ "soldiers, the Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to "
#~ "heavier, more advanced armours due to the freedom of movement it "
#~ "provides. Snipers and anyone else not expected to be at the front line "
#~ "will be able to make good use of the extra mobility.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests "

#~ "police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will "
#~ "perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for "

#~ "think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the "
#~ "census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. "
#~ "99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national "
#~ "authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves "
#~ "several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures "
#~ "that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we "
#~ "generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for "
#~ "identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping "
#~ "track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we "
#~ "need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to "
#~ "shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the "
#~ "equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the "
#~ "reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information "
#~ "will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of "
#~ "infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This "

#~ "Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
#~ "Operations Command\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific "
#~ "aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our "
#~ "planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's "
#~ "operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all "
#~ "the UFOs we might detect.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap "
#~ "we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" "
#~ "in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single "
#~ "airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in "
#~ "its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in "
#~ "radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, "
#~ "lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed "
#~ "almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced "
#~ "plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough "
#~ "to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. "
#~ "The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range "
#~ "into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
#~ "efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its "
#~ "hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for "
#~ "combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe "
#~ "allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply "
#~ "be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one "
#~ "engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional "
#~ "manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; "
#~ "this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
#~ "targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
#~ "(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the "
#~ "pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load "
#~ "of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular "
#~ "equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
#~ "and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. "
#~ "The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less "
#~ "expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's "
#~ "manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to "
#~ "change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic "
#~ "wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) "
#~ "and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing "
#~ "aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much "
#~ "more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not "
#~ "perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
#~ "deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
#~ "extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely "
#~ "slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than "
#~ "most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to "
#~ "catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary "
#~ "space.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't "
#~ "be measured without solid observational data from at least one real "
#~ "combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should "
#~ "be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"
