"Aircraft Evaluation -- Firebird-class Dropship\n"
"\n"
"CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"

"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 17 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to "
"replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of "
"dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
"dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got "
"out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving "
"examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government "
"warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of "
"storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even "
"find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best "
"to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade "
"our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four "
"HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The "
"HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered "
"aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose. It can also carry "
"additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 light weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated "
"fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO "
"sighting.\n"

"ท่านผู้บัญชาการ, ผมได้ตรวจสอบเอกสารเก่า "
"และขอนำเสนอการประเมินและข้อสรุปของผมในการเลือกยานลำเลียง "
"ผมต้องขอโทษด้วยที่อาจทำงานเกินอำนาจ แต่ยานบรรทุกเก่าของ PHALANX "
"นั้นล้าสมัยเกินกว่าจะใช้ในปัจจุบัน ไม่มีลำไหนได้รับการพัฒนาเกินยานต้นแบบเลย "
"มีตัวอย่างเหลือเพียงสองลำ และทั้งสองลำถูกทิ้งให้เสียหายในโรงเก็บของรัฐบาลมากว่า 60 ปี "
"ซึ่งไม่คุ้มจะเอามาปัดฝุ่นใช้ใหม่ เราได้รับแต่อุปกรณ์ตกทอดมาแย่ๆ "
"ผมยังไม่สามารถหาของที่เขาบอกว่ามีได้ถึงครึ่งด้วยซ้ำ "
"ผมได้พยายามเต็มที่เพื่อหาทางเลือกแทนของที่ไม่สามารถใช้งานได้อย่างที่หวัง\n"
"\n"
"โชคดีนิดหน่อยที่ด้านยานบรรทุกนั้น "
"ผมสามารถแนะให้สหประชาชาติยอมสนับสนุนงบประมาณบางส่วนสำหรับยานใหม่ "
"และผมคิดว่าท่านต้องชอบ\n"
"\n"
"ยาน VTOL (ยานขึ้นลงแนวดิ่ง) รุ่นกาลีออธ ไฟร์เบิร์ด เป็นยานที่ดีที่สุดที่เราจะนำมาใช้เป็นยานบรรทุก "
"มันถูกออกแบบเป็นยานบรรทุกสินค้า แต่ได้ถูกนำมาเปลี่ยนเป็นยานบรรทุกทหารโดยบริษัทผลิตอาวุธ "
"และได้กลายเป็นตัวเลือกแทนเฮลิคอปเตอร์ทั้งด้านการทหารและพลเรือน เนื่องจากเครื่องยนต์ HM-5600 "
"สี่ตัว ซึ่งทำให้ไฟร์เบิร์ดสามารถขึ้นลงได้ในแนวดิ่ง และประหยัดพลังงาน "
"โดยมีชิ้นส่วนเคลื่อนไหวน้อยกว่าเฮลิคอปเตอร์ แต่เครื่อง HM-5600 ก็ยังกินน้ำมัน "
"และค่าน้ำมันเครื่องบินกำลังสูง ก็ยังแพงเกินกว่าจะไปใช้ด้านพลเรือนได้\n"
"\n"
"อัตราความเร็วปกตอยู่ที่ 0.74 มัค และความเร็วสูงสุดที่ 1.03 มัคซึ่งทำให้มันเร็วกว่าเสียงเล็กน้อย "
"แต่มันจะทำให้โครงสร้างรับแรงกดมาก และไม่ควรใช้นอกจากเหตุฉุกเฉิน "
"มันมีจุดติดอาวุธหนึ่งแห่งตรงปลาย ซึ่งจะติดอาวุธการรบทางอากาศเช่นปืนใหญ่หรือฐานมิซไซล์ "
"และยังสามารถติดตั้งอุปกรณ์เสริมเพื่อเพิ่มความสามารถด้านการบินและการรบ มีที่สำหรับทหารแปดคน "
"และช่องเก็บของที่สามารถบรรทุกพาหนะรบขนาดเล็กได้\n"
"\n"
"ไม่มียานรบใดจะเหมาะกับเรามากกว่าไฟร์เบิร์ด ยานนี้เร็วกว่าคอปเตอร์ "
"คล่องตัวกว่าเครื่องบินที่มีปีกปรับไม่ได้ และสามารถปฏิบัติงานได้เร็วและมีประสิทธิภาพทั่วโลก\n"
"\n"
"ไฟร์เบิร์ดต้องใช้โรงเก็บเครื่องบินใหญ่ 1 แห่งในการเก็บ การบำรุงรักษา และการปฏิบัติการ "
"มันมีจุดติดอาวุธขนาดกลางหนึ่งแห่งตรงปลาย\n"

"\n"
"ยานบรรทุกจะลำเลียงทหารของเราไปทั่วโลก เพื่อตอบโต้การโจมตีภาคพื้นของมนุษย์ต่างดาว "
"หรือเพื่อตรวจสอบจุดตกของจานบินเพื่อทำการเก็บกู้ ต้องมีการส่งกำลังไปที่จุดที่มีมนุษย์ต่างดาว "
"และเพื่อเก็บกู้ซากอุปกรณ์ต่างดาว\n"
"\n"
"เมื่อจัดการมนุษย์ต่างดาวเสร็จสิ้น ทหารที่บาดเจ็บหนักจะถูกรับตัวมารักษา "
"ส่วนที่เหลือจะอยู่ต่อจนกว่าทีมเก็บกู้จะเข้ามาดำเนินงาน และจัดการขนส่งสมบัติต่างดาวกลับฐาน "
"นี่เป็นสิ่งสำคัญเพราะการเข้ามาโขมยสิ่งของในสนามรบเป็นปัญหาในเขตที่มีประชากรหนาแน่น "
"เราต้องไม่ให้วิทยาการต่างดาวอันมีค่าต้องสูญหาย เพราะไอ้งี่เง่าบางคนอยากจะเก็บของที่ระลึก\n"
"\n"

"Aircraft Evaluation -- Stiletto-class Interceptor\n"
"\n"
"CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 04 November 2026\n"
"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
"generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests "
"with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest "
"piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "
"speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air "
"channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and "
"redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They "
"are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can "
"hover unassisted for an extended period before burning through all their "
"fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "
"complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at "
"all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire "
"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"
"the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not "
"limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and "
"optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed "
"in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can "
"actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of "
"armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. "
"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
"Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its "
"maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within "
"this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
"recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
"described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 heavy wing "
"mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
"threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with "
"anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed "
"against distant targets as it won't have enough fuel for both attack "
"manoeuvres and the flight back to base.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but "
"the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for "
"us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race "
"is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
"person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
"little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they "
"held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most "
"manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and "
"can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern "
"aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at "
"speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. "
"However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can "
"handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track "
"down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being "
"restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight "
"testing on my own authority.\n"
"\n"
"This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. "
"We're going to need it."

"CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"

"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
"and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts into weapons capacity. The "
"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "
"nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to "
"dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the "
"Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that "
"implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain "
"effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. "
"It has 2 medium weapon hardpoints.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
"extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed "
"by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of "
"the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the "
"aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be "
"measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat "
"encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able "
"to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"แต่ผมแทบจะหัวใจวายเมื่อพบว่ามีอะไรอยู่ในนั้้นบ้าง การบรรจุเต็มถังที่ 2/10 กรัม "
"ซึ่งสามารถสร้างแรงระเบิดได้มากกว่า 8 กิโลตัน โดยเปรียบเทียบแล้วระเบิดที่ฮิโรชิมานั้นมีขนาด 13 "

"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien expeditions. It "
"is frequently deployed to engage aerial targets or even as a diversion to "
"mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly "
"fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side "
"to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter "
"engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This "
"weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough "
"research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, "
"it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely "
"dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of "
"light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or "
"disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it "
"mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting "
"computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air "
"engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us "
"to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster "
"than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a "
"craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull "
"materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The "
"aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current "
"technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "
"armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few "
"tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to "
"be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO "
"does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will "
"not be enough to harm nearby craft.\n"
"\n"

"function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more "

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here "
"is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some "
"kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and a sizeable team of "
"aliens in a passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance "
"has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading "
"material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply "
"ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo "
"we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship "
"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "
"in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our "
"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs "
"we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The "
"long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately "
"apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"\n"
"เท่าที่เราทราบ จานบินประเภทนี้เป็นยานขนส่ง "
"ซึ่งขนส่งวัสดุในห้องเก็บของขนาดใหญ่และขนส่งพวกต่างดาวได้ถึง 12 ที่ในห้องโดยสารเล็กหลังห้องบังคับ "
"การตรวจด้วยดาวเทียมพบว่ายานเหล่านี้จะลงจอดในพื้นที่ครอบครองของพวกต่างดาว "
"และขนถ่ายวัตถุดิบและผู้โดยสาร ซึ่งเป็นหลักฐานสนับสนุนทฤษฎี \"ยานเสบียง\" "
"และเราเชื่อว่ามันถูกต้อง\n"
"\n"
"เราสามารถสรุปได้จากโครงสร้างจานบินและห้องเก็บของที่เราเก็บกู้ได้หลายอย่าง "
"ยานเสบียงถูกออกแบบให้ขนถ่ายของจำนวนมากแทนที่จะให้เอาตัวรอดในสนามรบ มันไม่มีความคล่องตัว "
"เครื่องยนต์ไม่มีกำลังและไม่ดีเท่า โครงสร้างเสียหายง่ายหากโดนโจมตี "
"ทำให้ยานเสบียงต้องถูกป้องกันด้วยยานรบจำนวนมาก เผื่อกรณีโดนโจมตี\n"
"\n"
"ไม่มีของอะไรมากนักที่บรรทุกมากับเรือเสบียงเว้นแต่กำลังเสริมกับอุปกรณ์ต่างๆ มันจะนำอาวุธ อะไหล่ "
"และของจำเป็นอื่นๆ มาจากดาวของพวกนั้นเพื่อสนับสนุนการปฏิบัติการ "
"ซึ่งเราต้องป้องกันไม่ให้เกิดขึ้นทุกวิถีทาง "
"เพราะการตั้งฐานถาวรของพวกต่างดาวย่อมทำให้พลเรือนในบริเวณมีอันตราย "
"การมีพวกต่างดาวอยู่ย่อมทำให้การปฏิบัติงานของเรามีอุปสรรคในหลายแง่ บางอย่างก็ไม่เด่นชัด "
"บางอย่างก็ชัดเจน "
"การทำงานของเรือเสบียงอย่างต่อเนื่องอาจหมายความว่าการตั้งฐานกำลังมีการก่อสร้าง "
"หรือที่แย่กว่านั้นคือมันอาจใช้งานได้แล้ว\n"
"\n"
"ในอีกแง่หนึ่ง หากเราป้องกันไม่ให้ยานเสบียงเข้าถึงเขตแดนของพวกต่างดาวได้ "
"เราก็อาจทำให้พวกนั้นอดอยากได้สักพักก่อนที่เราจะส่งทหารเข้าไป "
"และนี่จะเป็นความได้เปรียบที่ำสำคัญของเรา\n"
"\n"
"สรุปแล้ว แม้ว่าัมันจะดูมีความสำคัญน้อยกว่าจานบินแบบอื่น ยานเสบียงก็ถูกโจมตีหากเป็นไปได้ "
"ผลประโยชน์ระยะยาวในการขัดขวางการขนถ่ายอาจไม่ชัดเจน แต่มันจะเห็นได้แน่เมื่อเวลาผ่านไป\n"

"main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any "
"other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and "
"protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and "
"more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion "
"does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely "
"strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
"possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "

"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
"priority target. Its firepower is more than a match for anything we can "
"currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared "
"to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we "
"have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This "
"is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, but in most "
"cases it won't be sufficient unless we upgrade our aerial capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on a Harvester to "
"take it out as fast as possible.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some "
"frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as "
"they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can "
"build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without "
"upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous "

"ยานนี้ -- ที่เราเรียกว่า \"ยานเก็บเกี่ยว\" -- ออกแบบมาโดยเฉพาะเพื่อลงจอดบนผิวดาว "

"\n"
"ในอากาศ ยานเก็บเกี่ยวมีความอันตรายมาก และควรจะเป็นเป้าหมายการโจมตีแรกๆ "
"การมีปืนลำแสงอนุภาคสองกระบอก และเครื่องยิงจรวด ทำให้อาวุธของมันมากเกินพอจะรับยานของเรา "

"Commander, I'm happy to report that we've cracked the code. We now have a "
"list of primary EW (Electronic Warfare) frequencies used by the aliens, and "
"a good understanding of how this powerful piece of electronics does what it "
"does.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, before you get too excited, let me stress that we have not found "
"a magic path through the aliens' defences. Regardless of what we take away "
"from this research, it's not going to end the war or make UFOs any less "
"dangerous. This is because of the EW suite's most important function -- it "
"has an independent onboard intelligence that adapts to its combat "
"environment.\n"
"\n"
"This intelligence is continually experimenting, trying to keep enemy systems "
"off-balance, changing its methods and deviating from its preferred "
"frequencies to try ones that might be more difficult to work with but could "
"bypass enemy jamming. We even believe that, when patched into a UFO's main "
"computer, this suite will hook into other onboard systems to make efficiency-"
"increasing adjustments based on enemy EW activity. Particularly to the "
"targeting computers.\n"
"\n"
"Besides the intelligent computer at its heart, the suite has projectors of "
"every kind, capable of saturating virtually any frequency in the "
"electromagnetic spectrum, even several frequencies at a time. It is also "
"capable of 'throwing' heat several metres away from the craft, causing "
"thermal spikes on infrared sensors that can fool missiles and draw them away "
"from the real target. Lastly the suite comes with a set of decoys that can "
"emulate practically any sensor signature, deployed as and when the computer "
"thinks it's necessary.\n"
"\n"
"With some modifications, we've been able to make the suite work with our "
"current aircraft electronics. Our main success has been in developing a set "
"of software upgrades which patch the alien EW suite into the onboard "
"intelligence systems of our aircraft. It's a hack if there ever was one, but "

"During air trials of the new armour, one of our own \"Sparrowhawk\" missiles "

"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "

"specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
"course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "

"this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
"astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
"system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
"intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', "
"'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters "
"can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you "
"want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when "
"plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do "
"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "
"found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs "
"with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for "
"navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "
"far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of "
"the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon "
"of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as "
"the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system "
"plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information "
"will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of "
"knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into "
"the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but "
"I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared "
"to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with "
"these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we "

"advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the "
"engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. "
"Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are "
"constructed, how to control them, and how we might be able to use them in "
"new aircraft designs. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely "
"expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the "
"sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this "
"really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and "
"control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just "
"an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these "
"matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start "
"using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious "
"re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a "
"tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the "
"force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. "
"The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human "
"body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have "
"trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to "
"be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and "

"result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust "
"limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during "

"fluoride-powered laser with megawatt-range output, capable of tracking and "
"hitting UFOs at ranges of up to 5 kilometres. Accuracy is excellent, "
"hampered only by enemy ECM (Electronic Countermeasures), and unlike in all "
"our other weapons it is not affected by range. The laser proceeds in a "
"straight line and crosses the distance between gun and target almost "
"instantly. It's hard to miss with it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser rapidly "
"loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At maximum range, 5 "
"kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on the same spot to hole "
"a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much time to wait for a kill. "
"The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it "
"strikes a good balance between damage and distance. Average damage per "
"second at these distances is slightly less than the SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but "
"range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so than any of our previous "
"weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for driving and pinning down the "
"enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing up "
"to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are both "
"too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to large off-"
"base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not need to keep "
"laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like to "
"recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our airfleet "
"except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. Anything "
"that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty keeping hold "
"of the target with SHIVAs, so the laser offers a far better solution with "
"nearly as much staying power.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is designed for close-range dogfighting. For this reason, we "
"recommend it should be part of a larger armaments pack that includes longer-"
"range weapons where possible. When closing on an enemy it is extremely "
"deadly, but if it is the only weapon available to a pilot he will be "
"vulnerable during the long approach.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"\n"
"This is a \"Sparrowhawk\" guided anti-aircraft missile. It is designed to be "
"loaded into the \"Sparrowhawk\" AA Missile Rack.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the "
"prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary "
"digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of "
"'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted "

"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. "
"Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at "
"launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not "
"to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate "
"approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of "
"miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is "
"greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten "
"kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at "
"their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the "
"greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with "
"Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, "
"our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this "
"idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we "
"should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that "
"needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-"
"air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground "
"operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets "
"with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
"considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets "
"until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
"been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for "
"the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had "
"left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with "
"full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with "
"rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to "
"his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they "
"can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets "
"are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and "
"fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all "
"eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket "
"actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can "
"fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back "
"to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single "
"volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "

"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"

"aircraft. In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, "
"tearing mercilessly into a target. However, its limited range and accuracy "

"instantly. It's hard to miss with it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser rapidly "
"loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At maximum range, 5 "
"kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on the same spot to hole "
"a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much time to wait for a kill. "
"The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it "
"strikes a good balance between damage and distance. Average damage per "
"second at these distances is slightly less than the SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but "
"range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so than any of our previous "
"weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for driving and pinning down the "
"enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing up "
"to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are both "
"too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to large off-"
"base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not need to keep "
"laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like to "
"recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our airfleet "
"except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. Anything "
"that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty keeping hold "
"of the target with SHIVAs, so the laser offers a far better solution with "
"nearly as much staying power.\n"

"\n"
"The missile's main structure consists of a rigid outer casing of alien "

"The rocket is by far the most powerful missile engine ever seen on Earth, "

"รูปทรงที่เปลี่ยนตามกระแสไฟฟ้านี้จะเกิดขึ้นก่อนทรงที่เปลี่ยนด้วยความร้อนเสมอ\n"

"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "

"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "

"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "

"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "

"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "

"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearance is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "

"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"\n"
"ตอนที่ทหารเครือจักรภพได้เดินทางถึงมุมไบอย่างงุนงงและไม่แน่ใจ พวกเขาโดนกลุ่มชาวท้องถิ่นรุมล้อน "
"โดยที่พวกนั้นกลัวสุดขั้วหัวใจและต้องการหาสิ่งปกป้อง ทหารส่วนใหญ่พูดภาษานั้นไม่ได้ด้วยซ้ำ "
"และไม่เข้าใจว่าคนท้องถิ่นพูดอะไร พอถามว่าเกิดอะไรขึ้น พลเรือนเพียงแต่ตะโกนว่า \"เซอร์ตา ออว์มา"
"\" -- เป็นภาษาฮินดูแปลว่า \"วิญญาณร้าย\" หรือ \"ปีศาจ\"\n"
"\n"
"คำนี้ได้ถูกตัดสั้นเป็น \"ทามา\" ในภาวะเร่งรีบ และในตอนที่การยิงกันสิ้นสุดคำนี้ก็เปลี่ยนไปอีก "
"ทุกคนตัดสินใจเลือก \"ทามาน\" (อ่านว่า \"ทา-มาน\") "
"เป็นศัพท์เรียกสัตว์ร้ายสีเทาที่ได้ไล่ฆ่าพวกเขา ชื่อนี้ก็ยังอยู่ "
"แต่เราก็ยังพูดไ้ด้เต็มปากว่ามนุษย์ต่างดาวพวกนี้มีเนื้อหนัง มากกว่าที่จะเป็นไฟและความมือ\n"
"\n"
"สิ่งแรกที่น่าสนใจคือข้อเท็จจริงที่ว่าสิ่งมีชีวิตนี้ดูคล้ายมนุษย์ มีสองแขน สองขา ส่วนหน้าอก และหัว "
"เดินด้วยสองขา อวัยวะในการมองเห็น ดมกลิ่น และการได้ยิน ต่างก็อยู่ในตำแหน่งเดียวกัน "
"แขนและขาของพวกนั้นมีนิ้วสามนิ้ว นิ้วหนึ่ง (\"นิ้วโป้ง\") นั้นแตะนิ้วอื่นถึง "
"เผ่าพันธุ์นี้โดยเฉลี่ยจะเตี้ยกว่ามนุษย์ และมีโครงสร้างที่ผอมและละเอียดอ่อน ซึ่งซ่อนความแกร่งเอาไว้\n"
"\n"
"เผ่าพันธุ์นี้มีอวัยวะสำคัญแบบทั่วไป: หัวใจ, ปอด, ตับ, และอื่นๆ "
"มันไม่มีอวัยวะส่วนเกินหรือที่ไม่ได้ใช้อย่างที่มนุษย์ติดตัวมาจากวิัวัฒนาการ ทางชีววิทยา "
"เผ่าพันธุ์นี้มีข้อน่าสนใจอยู่ที่ระบบย่อยอาหาร สิ่งมีชีวิตนี้มีสามกระเพาะ ซึ่งมีไว้เพื่อย่อยพืช "
"และไม่สามารถย่อยเนื้อได้ทุกชนิด ซึ่งหมายความว่า ไม่ว่ามันมาจากไหนก็ตาม พวกทามานเป็นสัตว์กินพืช "
"การค้นพบนี้ทำให้ทีมงานของเราโล่งใจ "
"อย่างน้อยเราก็รู้ว่ามนุษย์ต่างดาวพวกนี้ไม่ได้มาล่าเราเป็นอาหาร\n"
"\n"
"ตาขนาดใหญ่ทำให้ทามานสามารถมองเห็นในที่มือได้ "
"และมันมีม่านตาพิเศษที่จะป้องกันเรตินาจากแสงสว่างจ้าเช่นแสงอาทิตย์ "
"แต่หากมีแสงจ้าโดนเข้าที่เรติน่าก่อนที่ม่านตาจะปรับตัวได้ทาน มันอาจทำให้ตาบอดชั่วคราวหรือถาวรได้ "
"ประทัดแสงของเราจะน่ามีประสิทธิภาพมาก\n"
"\n"
"ผิวสีเทานี้เป็นคุณสมบัติที่น่าสนใจ เพราะมาันเกิดจากการหลั่งสารซิลิโคน "
"ซึ่งจะทำให้ผิวชั้นในแข็งขึ้นเสมือนกับเกราะโดยธรรมชาติ "
"ทำให้ทามานทนทานต่อแรงกระแทกและความร้อนพอสมควร\n"
"\n"
"จากการวิเคราะห์ของเราได้ข้อสรุปดังนี้\n"
"\n"
"-- ทามานทนต่อกระสุนและแรงทุบได้โดยธรรมชาติ "
"แต่ถึงกับที่จะทำให้อาวุธพวกนี้ไร้ประสิทธิภาพเสียทีเดียว\n"
"\n"
"-- ผิวหนังจะปกป้องความร้อนเล็กน้อยถึงปานกลาง แต่การใช้เครื่องพ่นไฟหรือสารสร้างไฟจะยังมีผล "
"เลเซอร์จะมีประสิทธิภาพน้อยกว่าปกตินิดหน่อย\n"
"\n"
"-- แม้ว่าร่างกายจะมีความยืดหยุ่น อวัยวะภายในของทามานก็ไม่สามารถรับแรงปะทะได้เลย "
"ทำให้แรงอัดของแรงระเบิดมีประสิทธิภาพมาก\n"
"\n"
"การศึกษาทำให้ทฤษฎีอื่นๆ ตกไป แม้ว่ารูปร่างของทามานจะคล้ายกับมนุษย์ "
"จนแทบจะเรียกได้ว่ามีความเกี่ยวข้องกัน ก็น่าจะเป็นกรณีของการวิวัฒนาการคล้ายคลึง "
"(วิถีที่ต่างกันนำมาสู่ผลลัพธ์เดียวกัน) มากกว่า่ที่จะมีความสัมพันธ์กัน "
"ลักษณะยีนของทามานกับมนุษย์คล้ายกันเพียงเล็กน้อย และโครงสร้าง DNA "
"ของพวกนั้นซับซ้อนกว่าเราหลายเท่า ซึ่งทำให้ทฤษฎีที่ว่ามีต้นกำเนิดเดียวกันตกไป\n"
"\n"
"ในสนามรบ, ทามานเป็นตัวปัญหาสำคัญ "
"พวกนี้คล่องแคล่วและสามารถใช้อาวุธหลายประเภทได้อย่างแม่นยำ นอกจากจะเป็นทหารแล้ว "
"พวกนี้ยังทำหน้าที่ผู้ควบคุมอาวุธสงครามของพวกต่างดาว ซึ่งเป็นตำแหน่งที่มีทามานมากที่สุด "
"ทามานมักมีอาวุธซับซ้อนและเสื้อเกราะแบบใหม่มากกว่าเผ่าพันธุ์อื่น ทั้งนี้ก็น่าจะเพราะมีสมองใหญ่ "
"มีอวัยวะประสาทสัมผัส และอวัยวะในการควบคุมที่ละเอียดอ่อน\n"
"\n"
"ไม่ว่าทามานจะเป็นพวก \"มนุษย์สีเทา\" ตามเรื่องราวการลักพาตัวโดยจานบินสมัยก่อนหรือไม่ก็ตาม "
"ผมก็ไม่แน่ใจ แต่ก็ไม่น่าจะใช่ PHALANX ไม่เคยพิสูจน์รายงานเกี่ยวกับมนุษย์ต่างดาวได้ตั้งแต่ทศวรรษ "
"1950 และจานบินที่เราเห็นตอนนี้ก็ไม่มีรูปทรงจาน หากพวกนั้นสามารถรุกรานโลกได้ตั้งแต่ศตวรรษก่อน "
"ทำไม่พวกมันต้องรอถึงตอนนี้? มันไม่ค่อยมีเหตุผล -- แต่ใครจะรู้ว่าพวกต่างดาวคิดอะไรอยู่?\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans, possessing "
"digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this "
"species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely "
"blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to "
"process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to "
"make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They seem to wear no armour to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"They sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these "
"tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"CLASSIFIED LEVEL YELLOW\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"พวกเขาต้องเสียทหารสามกองร้อยเพียงเพื่อทำให้มนุษย์ต่างดาวหยุดเคลื่อนไหว "
"โดยยังไม่สามารถสร้างความเสียหายสำคัญได้เลย PHALANX ต้องเอาชนะอุปสรรคเหล่านี้ "
"และการจะทำได้เราต้องพึ่งพาวิทยการสูงสุดที่มนุษยชาตมี\n"

"โครงการเอ็กซคาร์ลิเบอร์ถูกตั้งขึ้น ไม่เพียงเพื่อค้นหาอาวุธที่เหมาะสมในการรบกับศัตรูต่างดาว "
"แต่ยังต้องค้นหาเกราะและอุปกรณ์สนามอื่น "
"ที่จะช่วยทหารของเราในการปฏิบัติภารกิจให้ลุล่วงและอยู่รอดปลอดภัย "
"อุปกรณ์เหล่านี้ถูกออกแบบเพื่อเพิ่มประสิทธิภาพในการรบ หรือโอกาสในการมีชีวิตรอดโดยรวมของทหาร\n"
"\n"
"การใช้เกราะในสนามรบไม่ได้หายไปโดยสิ้นเชิง "
"แม้ว่าส่วนใหญ่จะหมดประสิทธิภาพระหว่างช่วงต้นศตวรรษที่ 18 ถึงปลายศตวรรษที่ 20 "
"แต่มันกลับมาได้รับความนิยมในช่วงสงครามโลกครั้งที่หนึ่งในรูปหมวกเกราะเหล็ก "
"รูปแบบนี้ดำเนินต่อไปในสงครามโลกครั้งที่สอง และต่อมาได้ถูกปรับไปจากการสร้างเคฟลาร์ "
"แต่ปัจจุบันเคฟลาร์นั้นล้าสมัยแล้ว ตอนนี้มันถูกใช้กับพลเรือนและตำรวจที่มีงบประมาณจำกัดเท่านั้น "
"แม้แต่ชุดเกราะที่ทันสมัยที่สุดในช่วงศตวรรษที่ 20 ยังกลายเป็นสิ่งที่่ไม่มีประโยชน์ด้วยน้ำมืออาวุธสมัยใหม่ "
"เราต้องการวัสดุแบบใหม่ ซึ่งจะทำให้เกราะแข็งแกร่ง และผู้สวมใส่เข้มแข็งยิ่งขึ้น\n"
"\n"
"น่าแปลกใจที่บันทึกเก่าที่เราพบได้แสดงว่า PHALANX มีส่วนในการสร้างวิทยาการใหม่ๆ ในอดีต "
"ซึ่งเป็นวิทยการที่ทั่วโลกได้นำไปใช้ ในการพยายามสร้างใยแมงมุมเทียมนั้นล้มเหลวมาโดยตลอด "
"แต่นักวิจัยของศูนย์ปฏิบัติการ PHALANX ในแผนกปฏิบัติการแปซิฟิคสามารถทำได้ในปี 2017 "
"เทคนิคนี้ก็ยังคงใช้ถึงปัจจุบัน ซึ่งอยู่ที่การใช้เครื่องมือที่เรียกว่า 'แกนปั่นด้ายอินทรีย์' "
"ซึ่งเป็นโครงขนาดใหญ่ที่รองรับกลุ่มของต่อมและแกนปั่นไหม "
"ซึ่งออกแบบสำหรับการผลิตใยแมงมุมแบบอุตสาหกรรม\n"
"\n"
"การเริ่มใช้เกราะรบที่ทำจากใยแมงมุมในทางการทหาร เกิดจากความพยายามร่วมของนาโต้ในปี 2023 "
"หลังจากการทดสอบวิถีกระสุนพบว่ากระสุนของจีนสามารถฉีกเสื้อเคฟลาร์ได้ "
"ชุดเกราะรบนี้มีใยแมงมุมซ้อนกับโพลีเอธีลีนโมเลกุลหนาแน่นพิเศษเป็นชั้น "
"ทำให้มีทั้งความแข็งแกร่งและยืดหยุ่น ผ้าที่ได้มีความแข็งแกร่งกว่าเหล็ก 18 เท่า "
"และมีประสิทธิภาพมากกว่าเสื้อเคฟลาร์ประมาณ 300 ถึง 400% "
"เสื้อผ้าที่ทำจากโพลีเอธีลีนนั้นกลายเป็นสิ่งล้าสมัยหลังจากที่ใยแมงมุมวิทยาศาสตร์นี้ออกขายในตลาด "
"และเกราะผสมรุ่นใหม่ก็ถูกนำมาแทนที่ของเก่าทั่วโลก เสื้อเกราะได้รับการพัฒนาตามระยะเวลา "
"และมีประสิทธิภาพขนาดที่ยังนำมาใช้กันในปัจจุบัน เสื้อนี้ยังมีกระเป๋าทั้งด้านหน้าและหลัง "
"เพื่อให้ใส่เซรามิคหรือโลหะเพื่อเพิ่มการปกป้องอวัยวะสำคัญได้อีก\n"
"\n"
"เสื้อเกราะรบมีข้อด้อยเพียงแค่ว่ามันมีน้ำหนักมากกว่าเกราะรุ่นเก่า "
"แต่มันก็มีสาเหตุมาจากจำนวนชั้นที่จำเป็นต้องมีเพื่อปกป้องอาวุธสมัยใหม่ได้อย่างเหมาะสม "

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "
"production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and comfortable aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to "
"crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy "
"compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size "
"any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for troops that "
"need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Commander, we've successfully prototyped our new powered armour. The "
"prototype is waiting in R&D if you'd like to have a go in it yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Our production design is geared towards maximum protection. It is, in a "
"nutshell, an airtight suit of armour with servo-assisted joints and an on-"
"board control system. The outer skin is a flexible three-layer composite, "
"with outer layers consisting of nanotube-fullerene fabric, and an inner "
"layer of special polymer gel, mixed with Wolfram-Molybdene powder. When the "
"outer layer of the composite is burned, the gel evaporates instantly, "
"dissipating the heat, and the metal powder will create a cloud around the "
"damaged area, thus creating a local bloom effect that will consume much of "
"the energy.\n"
"\n"
"The inside consists of a thick layer of memory gel covered by an "
"electrically sensitive lining. The gel allows the suit to be fitted to a "
"range of heights and body shapes, so hopefully we shouldn't have to custom-"
"build every suit to fit one specific soldier. The inner lining is an "
"important part of the control system; it detects nerve impulses through the "
"wearer's skin, interprets these signals, and uses them to predict the "
"wearer's movements before they're made. This allows the suit to move "
"simultaneously with the body rather than resisting the user's movements.\n"
"\n"
"A useful side effect of the memory gel is that it can absorb explosive "
"force, providing better shelter to explosive effects than any of our "
"previous models. Because the suit is entirely sealed, it provides much "
"better protection against environmental hazards such as gas and is effective "
"at dissipating heat, although a wearer can still be roasted inside the suit "
"if he sits in flames long enough. The helmet has built-in sensors to detect "
"flashbangs and cushion the wearer against momentary spikes of light and "
"noise intended to disorient the enemy.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma. This makes sense. It is their weapon of choice and "
"we would expect them to know how to protect against it. Because plasma "
"weaponry appears to have limited penetration capabilities, the armour is "
"able to disperse the heat before it can melt through the protective layers.\n"
"\n"
"The armour also performs pretty well against ordinary bullets and "
"explosives, although it's not very effective against incendiary devices or "
"flamethrowers. These weapons raise the atmospheric temperature around the "
"wearer so that there is no place to dump the heat, effectively roasting the "
"wearer inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll permit me, I'd like to raise a final issue with you, Commander. "
"One of my researchers has toyed with a personal laser project over the last "
"couple of months. While we were testing the alien armour, we allowed him to "
"experiment with it in his downtime and we were astonished by the results. "
"The relatively weak laser beam was hardly reduced as it passed through the "
"armor.\n"
"\n"
"I know that we've long believed that effective man-portable laser weaponry "
"is just a myth, but these suprise findings have reinvigorated my team. I'm "
"hearing all sorts of interesting proposals. This armour will seriously dent "
"our ability to use the aliens' plasma weaponry against them on the "
"battlefield. If we could use lasers to pack a reasonable punch into a hand-"
"held rifle, it could be the best response to their armor.\n"
"\n"
"Please give some thought to the laser weaponry ideas in your queue.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
"mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
"race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy "
"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "
"mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the "
"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing "
"open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will "
"still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "
"critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense "
"nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so "
"many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, "
"as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those "

"ในแง่ของเสื้อเกราะแล้ว พวกมนุษย์ต่างดาวดูจะใช้หลักการที่ว่า \"ถ้าใช้ได้ ก็ใช้มันมากๆ\" "

"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Research Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 16 February 1958\n"
"\n"
"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full "
"extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to "
"examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the "
"discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn "
"their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
"communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
"and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
"given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
"there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking "
"EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is "
"another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war "
"with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
"that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
"PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
"extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
"perform up to its design spec."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn "
"you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before "
"they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before "
"anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble "
"for whatever I say here. Just for the record, the bastarding SecDef can get "
"buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a "
"new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates "
"all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets "
"data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission "
"planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that "
"launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate "
"without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; "
"our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and "
"state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a "
"gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't "
"function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but "
"I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every "
"few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, "
"keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a "
"well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base "
"does get attacked, defending the CC should be a top priority, because "
"without it we will be unable to put up any kind of effective fight until it "
"can be repaired.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"The old CC blueprints have been updated by our engineers to replace the "
"ancient H-9000 mainframe and terminals with up-to-date holo-workstations and "
"a fresh supercomputer installation. All other components are still viable "
"and effective."

"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"

"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "

"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "

"\n"
"Filed: 18 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
"countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
"start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
"attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
"aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air "
"Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
"batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. "
"Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-"
"mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in "
"acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a "
"hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
"miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
"study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened "
"is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other "
"incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its "
"target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply "
"need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some "
"old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our "
"results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
"engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This "
"is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an "
"airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless "
"of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on "
"the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but "
"in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics "
"suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the "
"numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has "
"agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no "
"cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage "
"any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack "
"the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting "
"our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of "
"the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to "
"completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage "
"them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or "
"later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
"designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
"longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a "
"follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
"while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
"enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
"effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"มีการยิงมิซไซล์สี่สิบลูกจากฐานทั่วยุโรป ขณะที่ได้เล็งเป้าไปที่ยานต่างดาวสองลำ "

"\n"
"เราสรุปได้เลยว่า ความสามารถด้านวิทยาการอิเลคทรอนิคสของมนุษย์ต่างดาวนั้นเหนือกว่าเรามาก "
"อย่างไรก็ตาม PHALANX ได้ทำการศึกษาการยิงนัดที่ยิงถูก และพบว่ามันไม่ใช่เรื่องของโชค "
"เราพบว่าจานบินได้เปิดช่องว่างระหว่างที่บินหลบหลีกกระสุน ทำให้มิซไซล์สามารถล็อคเป้าได้จนเข้าเป้า\n"
"\n"
"ซึ่งพิสูจน์ได้ว่ามนุษย์ต่างดาวยังไม่สามารถเอาชนะมิซไซล์ของเราได้โดยสิ้นเชิง เราต้องใช้อาวุธที่ดีที่สุด "

"\n"
"\"ซิซาดา\" ยังมีโอกาสยิงโดยยานต่างดาวน้อย แต่ก็เพียงพอจะสร้างความเสียหาย "

"เกินกว่างบประมาณของเราที่จะพอใช้กับยานบินที่เข้ามาได้ทั้งหมด โชคดีที่สหประชาชาติยอมยก SAM "
"จากคลังสำรองมาให้เราใช้ฟรี\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"กฎข้อแนะนำ\n"
"\n"
"หากมีการสร้างฐานมิซไซล์ ฐานเหล่านี้สามารถยิงจานบินที่เข้าระยะ "

"การช่วยยานอินเตอร์เซปเตอร์ด้วยการ \"เจาะทะลวง\" จานบินด้วยมิซไซล์ "
"ก็ช่วยลดภาระของนักบินและยานบินได้ แต่เราไม่สามารถซ่อนฐานยิงมิซไซล์ได้ "
"แม้ว่าเราจะพยายามพรางตามากแค่ไหนก็ตาม การยิงจำนวนมากบ่อยครั้งจะทำให้เราถูกพบไม่ช้าก็เร็ว\n"
"\n"
"ฐานยิงมิซไซล์มีความเสี่ยงเพียงเล็กน้อยระหว่างการถูกโจมตีฐาน "
"ระบบนี้เป็นระบบป้องกันการเข้าโจมตีฐาน หากผู้รุกรานเข้าถึงฐานแล้ว "
"ระบบนี้ก็ไม่ได้เป็นอันตรายอะไรอีก เว้นแต่ว่าจะพยายามเปิดเส้นทางให้กับกำลังเสริม "

"Filed: 11 August 2008\n"
"\n"
"By: Gen. E. Baxter, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "
"equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid "
"deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house "
"and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "
"could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as "
"tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"\n"
"Filed: 11 August 2008\n"
"\n"
"By: Gen. E. Baxter, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Small Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 small "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Large Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously the Small Hangar cannot house large craft due to size "
"considerations.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Small Hangar is to house interceptors for the "
"interception of airborne UFOs. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "
"could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as "
"tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "
"for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s "
"with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the "
"first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the "
"results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment "
"available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness "
"against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, "
"nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is "
"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "
"are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their "
"work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be "
"needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed "
"and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work "
"space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If "
"extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our "
"bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research "
"programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire "
"base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of "
"opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives "
"inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage "
"to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Dr. Dolan Connor, 16 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Reviewing the files on PHALANX laboratory facilities, I have concluded that "
"these blueprints were well ahead of their time. The design is still viable "
"and can be adapted to our use with only minor equipment upgrades."

"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "
"personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and "
"several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "
"effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of "
"uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/"
"important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage "
"space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate "
"shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural "
"sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "
"designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can "
"take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and "
"supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of "
"tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear "
"blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the "
"event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current "
"tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it "
"the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven "
"minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close "
"-- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they "
"will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to "
"participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most "
"likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant "
"during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is "
"very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can "
"really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "
"installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual "
"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "
"rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "
"processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information "
"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the "
"extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as "
"effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range "
"is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further "
"installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "
"militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a "
"Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "
"no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering "
"the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien "
"craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most "
"they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on "
"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "
"and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the "
"UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the "
"facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with "

"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and "
"other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft "
"ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the "
"Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. "
"These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines "
"in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no "
"unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer "
"on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive "
"equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the "
"quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of "
"locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written "
"authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft "
"maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base "
"Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles "
"require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of "
"equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size "
"is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The "
"contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic "
"labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. "
"Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of "
"time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and "
"protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in "
"our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we "
"may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target "
"of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be "
"protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility "
"itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored "
"explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility "
"of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort "
"getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets "

"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX Workshop is a small-scale production line equipped with the most "
"high-tech military manufacturing processes available. It is designed for the "
"production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on "
"Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic "
"assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the "
"world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines "
"whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The "
"Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an "
"operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. "
"The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction "
"efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop "
"facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the "
"Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present "
"technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be "
"a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort "
"to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified "
"projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production "
"make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any "
"base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission "
"objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a "
"victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to "
"destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new "
"aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute "
"necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an "
"extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive "
"posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our "
"faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these "
"nightmare scenarios.\n"

"ภาพรวม\n"
"\n"
"ห้องช่างของ PHALANX นั้นมีขนาดเล็กแต่จะมีอุปกรณ์การผลิตทางการทหารที่ล้ำสมัยที่สุด "
"มันถูกออกแบบสำหร้ับผลิตวัตถุที่เป็นความลับ และชิ้นส่วนที่ที่อื่นในโลกไม่มี "
"รวมไปถึงการเลียนแบบวิทยการต่างดาว\n"
"\n"
"ทุกชิ้นส่วนที่ถูกผลิตในห้องช่างจะเป็นของทำมือ โดยจะใช้หุ่นยนต์ช่วยให้มากที่สุด "
"ต้องใช้วิศวกรทักษะสูงเพื่อใช้เครื่องจักรเหล่านี้ "
"และเพื่อติดตั้งเครื่องจักรใหม่เมื่อนักวิจัยของเราได้พัฒนากระบวนการผลิตใหม่หรือกระบวนการที่ดีขึ้น "
"ห้องช่างนี้จะเป็นสถานสำหรับวิศวกรทำงานได้ถึง 10 คนต่อครั้ง\n"
"\n"
"จำเป็นต้องมีแหล่งผลิตพลังงานเพื่อให้ทำงานได้ หากไม่มีแหล่งพลังงาน "
"การผลิตจะหยุดลงจนกว่าจะมีพลังงาน ห้องช่างยังต้องใช้ศูนย์บัญชาการในการประสานงานการก่อสร้าง\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"กฎข้อแนะนำ\n"
"\n"
"หากมีสงครามกับมนุษย์ต่างดาว เราต้องพึ่งพาห้องช่างในการผลิตอาวุธ \"War of the Worlds\" "
"ของ เอช. จี. เวล ได้แสดงว่าวิทยาการปัจจุบันของเราจะสามารถรับมือผู้รุกรานได้เล็กน้อยเพียงใด "
"แม้แต่การใช้ระเบิดอะตอมอาจไม่เพียงพอ ในกรณีที่เลวร้ายที่สุดเราการต้องใช้มิซไซล์นิวเคลียร์ "
"หากไม่มีทางเลือกอื่นในการหยุดยั้งการรุกราน\n"
"\n"
"ห้องช่างเป็นเขตควบคุมระดับสูง เนื่องจากโครงการส่วนใหญ่มีความอ่อนไหวและเป็นโครงการลับ "
"วัตถุที่มีควาามไม่เสถียรและมีพิษที่ใช้ในการผลิตทำให้เป็นสถานที่อันตราย "
"และมันจะเป็นเป้าหมายการโจมตีฐาน ในลักษณะการโจมตีเมื่อมีโอกาส "
"หรือแม้แต่ภารกิจที่มีความเสี่ยงปานกลาง "
"การหยุดการผลิตเป็นเวลานานย่อมหมายถึงชัยชนะของพวกต่างดาว "
"โดยเฉพาะหากพวกมันสามารถทำลายโครงการขนาดใหญ่ที่ดำเนินอยู่ เช่นการสร้างยานบินใหม่\n"
"\n"
"การเลียนแบบวิทยการการท่องอวกาศนั้นเป็นสิ่งจำเป็น หากเราต้องการจะเป็นฝ่ายรุกพวกต่างดาว "
"เราไม่สามารถอยู่ในโลกและคอยป้องกันตนเองหากเราต้องการจะหยุดความขัดแย้งทางการทหารโดยสิ้นเชิง "
"ห้องช่างและห้องวิจัยจะเป็นสิ่งที่ช่วยเราในกรณีที่เลวร้ายเช่นนั้น\n"

"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but "
"that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the "
"entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter "
"Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN "
"nuclear site register. At full capacity just one storage facility will be "
"containing the equivalent of nearly half a megaton of TNT. While this isn't "
"much compared to modern thermonuclear weapons, it's enough to turn the "
"entire base and everything inside to cinders in less than a second. It's "
"difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but under the wrong circumstances, it can "
"happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the "
"annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the "
"containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at "
"this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed "
"particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be "
"poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"

"Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would "
"be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap "
"at the Antimatter Storage.\n"

"\n"
"In addition to the base radar facility blueprints I submitted earlier today, "
"I'd like to submit these blueprints for a smaller off-base installation. Our "
"in-base facilities will never be able to cover the whole globe, so we'll "
"need to build some of these Radar Towers to fill any gaps in our coverage.\n"
"\n"
"The blueprints provide details to construct a small facility. This means "
"that each tower will cover only a small range, but they can be erected "
"quickly and cheaply to rapidly improve our operational capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The radar tower has a limited range compared to the facilities we've "
"designed inside the PHALANX bases, so they'll need to be produced quickly "
"and in large numbers to expand our radar coverage around the world.\n"
"\n"
"We should strive to cover as much of the earth as possible, but detecting a "
"UFO is meaningless if we can't shoot it down. We should concentrate our "
"construction on areas within range of our interceptors at first.\n"
"\n"
"The tower's camouflage is not very effective. Alien craft may detect the "
"active scanning and attempt to destroy the tower once they find it.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"If we're to survive this war, we'll need to do more than just detect and "
"knock down UFOs. We'll need to recover these crafts and initiate an active "
"research program that will investigate the alien technology to apply to our "
"own aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"To do this, we'll need a dedicated storage facility -- one that is far too "
"large to house on our bases. Please consider the attached blueprints, which "
"outline plans for how to securely store and camouflage any alien craft we "
"might recover. We'll be able to transport recovered craft to these "
"facilities and conduct the necessary research.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"UFOs stored in a UFO Yard can be researched and dismantled from any PHALANX "
"base with appropriate facilities, but these activities proceed more slowly "
"the further away the UFO Yard is from the base. UFO Yards should be built "
"nearby bases which will need access.\n"
"\n"
"UFOs can be transferred between different yards.\n"

"\n"
"I hope you've had a chance to read the blueprints I submitted earlier today "
"for a surface-to-air missile defense facility we can build at PHALANX bases. "
"We've hastily adapted those blueprints to design an off-base installation "
"that can run on its own grid.\n"
"\n"
"This facility can provide additional defensive hardpoints around key "
"strategic points. Although they remain vulnerable to detection and "
"destruction from alien craft, they at least provide additional assurances "
"that missile launchers won't expose the location of our bases.\n"

"In the year 2084, Earth is in better shape than it has been for more than a "
"century. Perhaps for the first time, peace and cooperation are the norm "
"rather than the exception. The current state of affairs, however, can only "
"be explained through the brutal history of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of "
"nations around the world. Tensions increased when Iran, Syria, Jordan and "
"Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite "
"the Islamic world. Soon after, democratic elections in Iraq caused the "
"United States to lose control of the country, and Iraq joined the Middle-"
"Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a "
"panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus "
"forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and "
"warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over "
"the years as a result.\n"
"\n"
"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-"
"East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. "
"The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several "
"years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim "
"promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military "
"invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily "
"ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did "
"nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China "
"annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to "
"disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day "
"invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the "
"Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could "
"even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from "
"the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades "
"to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold "
"War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese "
"territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to "
"nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under "
"a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the "
"country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become "
"increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of "
"world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps "
"became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the "
"army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country "
"to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not "
"approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often "
"referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It "
"saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, "
"and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul "
"and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six "
"50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the "
"civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it "
"was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More "
"than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on "
"15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale "
"scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian "
"Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"The Asian Republic:\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its "
"old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, "
"including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between "
"independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and "
"respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side "
"throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new "
"Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist "
"government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new "
"council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off "
"to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel "
"nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for "
"greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be "
"disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary "
"historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese "
"researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the "
"world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly "
"joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour "
"its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging "
"economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The "
"Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still "
"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but "
"it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops "
"are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-"
"old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due "
"to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most "
"of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with "
"one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat "
"poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "
"state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world "
"superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister "
"Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While "
"the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about "
"who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own "
"problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, "
"which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. "
"Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya "
"could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it "
"did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the "
"Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in "
"Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter "
"conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power "
"plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, "
"safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from "
"enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian "
"plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new "
"type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of "
"the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and "
"from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear "
"revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted "
"element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's "
"waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The "
"Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission "
"became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the "
"world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the "
"example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power "
"generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The "
"nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and "
"commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the "
"country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether "
"under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat "
"antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it "
"does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Oceania:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the "
"countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into "
"the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when "
"joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and "
"burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own "
"parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, "
"they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in "
"military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had "
"trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the "
"Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian "
"military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the "
"country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several "
"South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the "
"Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the "
"surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated "
"the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the "
"country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines "
"were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless "
"parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small "
"regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the "
"vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the "
"Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one "
"great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the "
"Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships "
"passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was "
"free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. "
"Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth "
"seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their "
"full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of "
"Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-"
"Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and "
"Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still "
"can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its "
"own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is "
"minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves "
"only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, "
"it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art "
"equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to "
"combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "
"budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some "
"new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the "
"opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but "
"after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into "
"obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its "
"commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their "
"aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk "
"couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's "
"slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the "
"country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in "
"2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was "
"dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown "
"into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered "
"reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The "
"existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter "
"of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The "
"massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them "
"secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on "
"television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of "
"their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap "
"of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things "
"got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, "
"Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it "
"began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session "
"continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with "
"lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien "
"invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. "
"It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in "
"the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, "
"however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one "
"could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the "
"Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as "
"well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned "
"missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that "
"counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital "
"defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear "
"missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish "
"projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one "
"aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, "
"designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an "
"invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it "
"to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part "
"of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, "
"known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the "
"world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a "
"hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to "
"resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was "
"tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were "
"dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the "
"secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support "
"and the men it needed to go to war.\n"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"New information has come to light that you need to see. We've discovered a "
"commonality that may give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered "
"some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained "
"sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the "
"problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, "
"again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for "
"storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I "
"spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found "
"the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our "
"blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be "
"found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed "
"that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. "
"The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge "
"numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for "
"each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. "
"Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of "
"chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its "
"source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no "
"variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to "
"believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in "
"part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
"infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests "
"on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. "
"The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or "
"positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are "
"essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism "
"requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a "
"parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a "
"complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it "
"acts and replicates exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is "
"warranted. As each alien species carries a unique strand of the infection, "

"\n"
"New information has come to light during the last batch of autopsies you "
"requested. Our reports stand, but we've discovered a commonality that may "
"give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered "
"some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained "
"sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the "
"problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, "
"again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for "
"storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I "
"spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found "
"the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our "
"blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be "
"found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed "
"that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. "
"The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge "
"numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for "
"each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. "
"Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of "
"chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its "
"source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no "
"variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to "
"believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in "
"part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
"infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests "
"on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. "
"The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or "
"positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are "
"essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism "
"requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a "
"parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is far more "
"complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like "
"one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien species carries "
"a unique strand of the infection, we have given them alphabetical "
"designations after the source species in which the strand can be found. "
"Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only "
"thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. "
"We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit "
"each species.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When "
"injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed "
"the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, "
"however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard "
"human T cells. The organism was unable to deactivate our immune system in "
"order to take root.\n"
"\n"
"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers "
"on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated "
"about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our personnel is "
"in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine procedures will be "

"Our study on antimatter is complete, Commander, and we're ready to present "
"our results. I'm afraid the news is mostly bad.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of things the aliens know that we don't. Nowhere is this "
"more clear in their widespread use of antimatter. It seems to be plentiful "
"for them, at least plentiful enough to send out UFO after UFO to Earth, "
"burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into antimatter, on the "
"other hand . . .\n"
"\n"
"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of "
"anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near "
"Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not long after, another "
"lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come slowly forward over the "
"years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by "
"the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
"availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with "
"every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
"antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
"gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a "
"UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over the "
"past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in "
"the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom "
"line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they "
"create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to "
"do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts "
"will be fruitless.\n"
"\n"
"Our only major successes have come from studying how the aliens store their "
"antimatter. We're confident we can employ the same magnetic storage "
"techniques, creating special facilities for safely storing antimatter. I've "
"sent you a set of blueprints in a separate message to peruse at your "
"convenience. We've also designed antimatter fuel tanks that should fit in "
"our interceptors given some major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full "
"understanding of the alien engines before we can begin designing a new "
"aircraft propulsion system.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If "
"we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering "
"it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may "
"have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we "
"are to have any chance of truly stopping the invasion.\n"

"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures in the device are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, "
"very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all "
"of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of "
"our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"

"My team has finished conducting a number of tests on our captives that have "
"shed some light on the aliens' behaviour.\n"
"\n"
"In one experiment, an alien specimen was given a box of food, sealed by a "
"two-digit number lock. The subject took six hours to find the right "
"combination by trial and error. This places the alien's IQ well below most "
"large terrestrial mammals; however, when other subjects in the Containment "
"were given the same task, with exactly the same lock, they all immediately "
"input the right combination on their first attempt without having been "
"exposed to the first specimen's attempts. We know how this looks, Commander, "
"but I assure you my team and I have been thoroughly conscientious about "
"security and separation. The aliens have not been allowed to communicate in "
"any way. We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about "
"these events, though we're working on it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at "
"best. Various ways of communication have been attempted without success. "
"Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do "
"not seem to speak or sign in any sense that we understand. Pheromone "
"communication has had no effect beyond simple physical reactions. The large "
"biological disparity between alien species also creates its own share of "
"problems with containment and communication -- please refer to the alien "
"autopsy reports for more details on individual alien physiology.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication "
"with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies "
"confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that "
"we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently "
"working on teaching an isolated group how to express desire, acknowledgement "
"and denial. Their intelligence is too limited to attempt anything more "
"sophisticated at the moment. Once the subjects have mastered these basic "
"concepts, we will have some data on the rate at which the aliens can learn, "
"and a solid foundation upon which to build. Yamamura hopes we can gradually "
"raise their communication skills until they can make themselves intelligible "
"to us, thereby spreading this knowledge to others of their kind who may "
"possess superior intellect and talents.\n"

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in "
"our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may "
"begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien "
"intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating "
"individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications "
"and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of "
"battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, "
"coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious "
"communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in "
"our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of "
"animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, "
"well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments "
"have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are "
"responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally "
"assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We "
"now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when "
"the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected "
"'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When "
"they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert "
"back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of "
"communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the "
"alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the "
"physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to "
"no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind "
"of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more "
"intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for "
"this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different "
"alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent "
"evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer "
"than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is "
"less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut "
"off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important "
"advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet "
"considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated "
"specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with "
"little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large "
"enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with "
"alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration "
"risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be "
"approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device "
"or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish "
"communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our "
"linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of "
"inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, if such experiments were to be approved by the Base Commander, I "
"assure you that my team would take full precautions. Nothing is more "
"important to us than the lives of our men and the security of our "
"facilities.\n"

"และเราได้ตั้งทฤษฎีที่อาจอธิบายความเฉลียวฉลาดที่เพิ่งเกิดขึ้นของพวกต่างดาวได้ดังนี้\n"
"\n"

"พวกมันจะเริ่มมีการเคลื่อนไหวมากขึ้นและแสดงภูมิปัญญาสูงขึ้น "
"แต่เมื่อแยกพวกต่างดาวจากกันในระยะห่างระดับหนึ่ง พวกนี้ก็จะกลายเป็นเหมือนเดิม "

"เราไม่แน่ใจว่าความคิดรังแมลงนี้กระจายในมนุษย์ต่างดาวพันธุ์ต่างกันได้อย่าง "
"เพราะแน่นอนว่าพวกต่างเผ่าพันธุ์มาจากดาวคนละดวง ที่มีวิวัฒนาการที่ต่างกันไป "
"และบางเผ่าพันธุ์ดูจะอยู่มานานกว่ากลุ่มอื่น "
"แต่หากเราคิดถึงความก้าวหน้าทางวิทยาการของพวกต่างดาวแล้ว คำถามว่า \"ทำอย่างไร\" "
"ดูจะน่าสงสยน้อยกว่าคำถามที่ว่า \"ทำไม\"\n"
"\n"
"การค้นพบนี้ดูจะแสดงว่าพวกต่างดาวบนโลก ฃถูกตัดขาดจากแหล่งปัญญา แม้ว่นี่จะเป็นข้อได้เปรียบของ "
"PHALANX แต่มันก็เป็นปัญหาที่เราไม่ได้คาดมาก่อนเช่นกัน การวิจัยจิตวิทยามนุษย์ต่างดาวได้แสดงว่า "
"มนุษย์ต่างดาวที่อยู่อย่างโดดเดี่ยวจะมีชีวิตในสภาพแวดล้อมของเราได้ไม่นาน "
"และจะแสดงพฤติกรรมฉลาดเพียงเล็กน้อย แต่หากมีกลุ่มขนาดพอสมควรหลบหนีไปได้ และร่วมมือกัน -- "
"หรือร่วมมือกับพวกท่สนับสนุนมนุษย์ต่างดาว -- "
"เราจะต้องเผชิญปัญหาการถูกล้วงความลับขนาดใหญ่ทีเดียว\n"
"\n"
"เมื่อมีพวกต่างดาวหลายตัว ความเฉลียวฉลาดของพวกนี้ดูจะใกล้เคียงกับมนุษย์ "
"หากเราสามารถสร้างเครื่องมือการแปล หรือภาษากลางได้ "

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"เพราะพวกนั้นมีความสามารถในการเดินทางเหนือความเร็วแสง ระบบขับเคลื่อนเร็วเหนือแสง(FTL: "
"Faster-Than-Light) ทำให้พวกนั้นสามารถ 'กระโดดข้าม' "

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. "
"It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting "
"a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to "
"answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the "
"ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal "
"-- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have "
"gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our "
"most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "
"thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then "
"channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO "
"extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing "
"it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system "
"continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to "
"keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used "
"to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If "
"a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a "
"gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the "
"Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as "
"possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to "
"jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on "
"the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of "
"the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion "
"represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is "
"that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, "
"regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation "
"detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be "
"impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, "
"every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at "
"high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is "
"quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a "
"memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a "
"more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a "
"more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher "
"than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far "
"more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components "
"and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this "
"craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the "
"individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve "
"deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to "
"counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I "
"can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us "
"in the fight for Earth.\n"

"เรียนท่านผู้บัญชาการทีมของผมได้ทำการวิเคราะห์จานบินที่เราจับควบคุุมได้่ก่อนหน้านี้มันเป็นเรื่องมหัศจรรย์ในทางวิศวกรรมศาสตร์อย่างแท้จริง "
"และเราตั้งตารอโอกาสที่จะเอาวิทยาการที่น่าลงไหลนี้มาแทนของเดิมของที่เรามีอยู่\n"
"\n"
"วิธีการสร้างยานอันแปลกประหลาดนำมาซึ่งคำถามจำนวนมากที่ให้เราหาตอบการออกแบบจำนวนมากดูเหมือนว่าจะไม่เข้าใจเลยเมื่อมองจากพื้นฐานของมันแต่เมื่อเราดูเข้าไปใกล้ "
"ๆ "
"และทดสอบวัสดุที่ใช้ทำตัวยานในห้องทดลองเราได้รับภาพที่ชัดเจนเกี่ยวกับคุณลักษณะของจานบินผมได้ทำรายการสิ่งที่เราค้นพบและคิดว่าสำคัญไว้แล้ว\n"
"\n"
"-- ระบบขับเคลื่อนของยานมนุษย์ต่างดาวเป็นแบบจรวดแต่ไม่เหมือนอันไหน ๆ "
"ที่สร้างขึ้นบนโลกใช้การระเบิดของสสารและปฏิสสารเพื่อสร้างแรงพลักดันโดยการยิงโปรตรอนและปฏิโปรตรอนเข้าไปในห้องทำปฏิกริยาและปล่อยแรงระเบิดออกทางท้ายของเครื่องยนต์นี้เป็นปัจจัยที่ทำให้จานบินมีพลังอย่างมหาศาลและไม่จำเป็นต้องใช้อากาศหรือก๊าซอื่น "
"ๆ "
"เพื่อทำปฏิกิริยาทำให้สามารถเผาไหมได้แม้อยู่ในสุญญากาศพร้อมทั้งระบบหล่อเย็นที่เหนือชั้นคอยส่งไนโตรเจนเหลวผ่านห้องเครื่องยนต์เพื่อรักษาความเย็นและลดสัญญาณอินฟราเรดที่เกิดขึ้นอีกทั้งความร้อนจากเครื่องยนต์ยังใช้สร้างพลังงานไฟฟ้าด้วย\n"
"\n"
"-- ถังเชื้อเพลิงเล็กมาก ๆ "
"ไม่ถึงหนึ่งกรัมด้วยซ้ำที่สำคัญผมตกใจมากเมื่อรู้ว่าปฏิสสารอยู่ข้างในถังถ้าถังเชื้อเพลิงเกิดเสียหายขึ้นมากปฏิสสารน้ำหนัก "
"0.3 "
"กรัมจะทำให้แรงระเบิดปรมณูขนาดเดียวกับที่ใช้กับฮิโรชิมาเลยโดยปกติแล้วถังเชื้อเพลิงนั้นหุ้มด้วยเครื่องป้องกันและเก็บในส่วนลึกสุดของตัวยานและยังมีกลไกเพื่อดีดถังเชื้อเพลิงออกในกรณีฉุกเฉินแต่ยังไม่สมบรูณ์เท่าที่ควรถ้าถังเกิดถูกกระแทกอาจจะทำให้เกิดระเบิดได้การระเบิดยังคงอยู่ในตัวยานแต่ก็ยังคงอันตรายอย่างยิ่งยวดสำหรับยานขับไล่ของเราอยู่ดีขอดีอย่างเดียวของการระเบิดของสสารและปฏิสสารคือกัมมันตภาพรังสีเพียงเล็กน้อย\n"
"\n"
"-- การตรวจจับจานบินด้วยเครื่องมือที่มนุษย์มีอยู่ยากมาก ๆ "
"ถ้าไม่นับรวบชิ้นส่วนอาวุธที่เป็นอิเล็คทรอนิคตัวยานหุ้มด้วยวัสดุที่ดูดซับรังสีทุกชนิดได้เป็นอย่างดีแต่เราก็ยังโชคดีอยู่บางในการตรวจจับเพราะเครื่องยนต์สสารและปฏิสสารก่อให้เกิดรังสีอินฟราเรดและรังสีแกมม่าเป็นจำนวนมาก\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be "
"impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, "
"every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at "
"high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is "
"quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a "
"memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a "
"more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a "
"more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher "
"than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far "
"more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components "
"and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this "
"craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the "
"individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve "
"deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to "
"counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I "
"can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us "
"in the fight for Earth.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "
"a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take "
"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"
"\n"
"Alien Materials should now be available for use in production. "
"Unfortunately, they require a lot of rare and expensive components, some of "
"which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we "
"could obtain the materials needed in quantities that would make non-trivial "
"production possible. We'll have to salvage what we need off the aliens, "
"because we won't be able to produce any of it for the forseeable future.\n"

"ท่านผู้บัญชาการ, ผมคิดว่าเราได้ค้นพบความลับของวัสดุของพวกมนุษย์ต่างดาวแล้ว "

"ให้มันแปลงรูปร่างที่ซับซ้อนขึ้นได้\n"

"ผมได้เรียนแล้วว่า วัสดุของมนุษย์ต่างดาวได้สร้างรูปแบบ 'โลหะผสมที่มีความทรงจำ', "
"ซึ่งสามารถจดจำรูปแบบที่มันสามารถเปลี่ยนได้หากวัสดุนี้ได้รับตัวกระตุ้นที่เหมาะสม "
"ที่น่าทึี่งคือโลหะผสมต่างดาวนี้สามารถถูกกระุตุ้นได้โดยสองสิ่ง: ความร้อนและกระแสไฟฟ้า "
"ความร้อนเป็นปัจจัยหลักที่ทำให้รูปร่างจานบินแผ่ออกขณะบินผ่านชั้นบรรยากาศ เพื่อให้การยกตัวดีขึ้น "
"แต่กระแสไฟฟ้านั้นเป็นตัวกระตุ้นที่เราเพิ่งรู้\n"
"\n"
"เมื่อใช้กระแสไฟฟ้า โลหะผสมนี้จะตอบสนองเฉพาะกระแสไฟฟ้าที่มีกระแสต่ำและมีค่าคงที่ในระดับเฉพาะ "
"รูปร่างของวัสดุจะเปลี่ยนแปลงและจะอยู่ในสภาพดังกล่าวตราบเท่าที่กระแสไฟฟ้านั้นยังจ่ายมาอย่างคงที่ "
"เมื่อปิดกระแสไฟฟ้า วัสดุจะคืนตัวสู่ภาวะ 'ผ่อนคลาย' ในรูปทรงปกติ "
"หรือทรงถูกความร้อนหากมีความร้อนอยู่ "
"รูปทรงที่เปลี่ยนตามกระแสไฟฟ้านี้จะเกิดขึ้นก่อนทรงที่เปลี่ยนด้วยความร้อนเสมอ\n"
"\n"
"ซึ่งหมายความว่ารูปทรงของจานบิน (หรืออะไรก็ตามที่ทำด้วยวัสดุนี้) จะสามารถเปลี่ยนได้ตามใจนึก "
"ไม่ว่าจะผ่านการควบคุมของผู้ใช้งานหรือด้วยระบบไฟฟ้าอัตโนมัติ\n"

"drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately "
"the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these "
"samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got an extensive report for you regarding our work on deciphering the "
"patterns of alien activity and their overall strategy for Earth. You can "
"find the full document in our archives, but I will give you a quick "
"summation here.\n"
"\n"
"The most striking characteristic we've seen of the invasion is that the "
"aliens have been harvesting human biomass, sometimes even whole people, for "
"their own nebulous purposes. They do this in a rather gruesome manner that "
"shows no respect for life; they cut up human beings as if butchering cattle, "
"and their Bloodspiders will simply dissect someone on the spot for a "
"particularly interesting organ or a pint of blood. It is utterly, amorally "
"practical.\n"
"\n"
"We can only assume that they use the samples they're gathering in some kind "
"of research program, studies into our physiology and perhaps our psychology "
"and culture as well. We don't know the reasons behind this, but it's an "
"interesting point. They are trying to learn something about us, and they "
"don't care how we feel about it. To them, we're merely objects to be "
"studied.\n"
"\n"
"Of further interest are their main targets. Until recently alien activity "
"reports came almost exclusively from high-density population centres with "
"easy landing access for UFOs, which ties in with the general objective of "
"capturing human research material. However, as of late the focus of the "
"campaign seems to have shifted or narrowed. Activity around hospitals, blood "
"banks and bio-research laboratories has been noticed more and more "
"frequently in addition to the usual raids on population centres. The "
"activity has ranged from low-key infiltration for unknown purposes up to "
"full-scale assaults on high-security labs. We're not sure yet what this "
"shift could mean, but we are making recommendations to the UN to sharpen "
"security in these facilities and arm local forces to stand up to alien "
"attack. We've marked up a list of high-risk targets for rapid police "
"response and are distributing handbooks on anti-alien tactics. More "
"investigation into the change of targets is underway.\n"
"\n"
"As always, there is a lot more alien activity going on outside of our "
"detection range which goes unreported by civilian authorities. DivIntel is "
"currently experimenting with new ways of reporting and responding to alien "
"activity as well as better networking between UN nations to get valid "
"information to PHALANX faster, all of which are direct results of our "
"research into the aliens' strategy. We expect that these techniques will "
"allow us to catch an estimated 10% of alien activity (out of total estimated "
"activity on Earth) that would have previously gone unreported.\n"
"\n"
"We've also looked into how UFOs are getting to and from Earth, despite our "
"problems finding and tracking the elusive larger craft we've observed. After "
"reviewing radar, lidar and video recordings made from observatories on the "
"planet surface, we now believe the larger UFOs to be some manner of aircraft "
"carrier; a simple FTL-equipped base ship ferrying smaller UFOs to and from "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"This craft is of extreme importance and we must find some way to shoot it "
"down from orbit if we can. We should keep a close guard, Commander.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Let me begin by stating a few ugly realities.\n"
"\n"
"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the "
"initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, "
"and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of "
"volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which "
"are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly "
"exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an "
"instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid "
"does come under attack, comms between PHALANX Command Centres and assets in "
"the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying "
"items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is "
"nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer "
"under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at "
"all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've "
"fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-"
"planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are "
"years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane "
"in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at "
"our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are "
"nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too "
"destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever "
"managed to score a hit. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into "
"extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that "
"has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're "
"going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, "
"but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are "
"starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is "
"to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency "
"to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our "
"extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base "
"colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with "
"enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library "
"of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns "
"into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. "
"We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to "
"lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built "
"into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in "
"front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on "
"the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling "
"block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in "
"order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its "
"own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the "
"UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- "
"to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, "
"heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely "
"necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"
"\n"
"As you see, Sir, these problems can all be overcome, but we need to do some "
"serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please "
"lend your authorisation as soon as is feasible.\n"

"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "

"Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
"succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
"achieves continuous wave output at a smaller scale than has ever been "
"achieved before.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
"battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to "
"lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical "
"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-"
"based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the "
"shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-"
"designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic molecules "
"before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced regularly, but we've designed the system to "
"make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during "
"the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in "
"order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production, since more refining and balancing is required for real-world "
"combat. I've submitted new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas "
"we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"เรียนท่านผู้บัญชาการ, "
"ผมมีความยินดีเป็นอย่างยิ่งที่จะแจ้งให้ทราบว่าโครงการของเราประสบความสำเร็จด้วยดี "
"ผมได้แนบภาพของอาวุธเลเซอร์ต้นแบบ ซึ่งสามารถสร้างคลื่นต่อเนื่องได้ "
"ด้วยขนาดที่บุคคลสามารถพกพาได้\n"
"\n"
"วิธีการที่ได้ผลนั้นไม่ใช่การพยายามสร้างแบตเตอรี่ขนาดใหญ่ให้เสียเวลา "
"แต่กลับเป็นการใช้วิทยาการการย่อส่วนในการทำให้ชิ้นส่วนเลเซอร์ที่ใช้สารเคมีเป็นตัวสร้างพลังงานนั้นมีขนาดเล็กและเบาลง "
"เลเซอร์เคมีนี้มีการใช้มาเป็นเวลานานแล้ว "
"และเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของโครงการทดลองอาวุธตั้งแ่ต่ปลายศตวรรษที่ 20 แต่ก็มักประสบปัญหา "
"เลเซอร์เคมีชนิดเดียวที่มีความเป็นไปได้ในทางการทหารนั้น "
"มีขนาดใหญ่และเทอะทะกว่าที่ทหารราบจะสามารถถือไปใช้ในสนามรบได้ "
"จนถึงตอนนี้การใช้ในการรบนั้นถูกจำกัดไว้กับปืนใหญ่เลเซอร์สำหรับรถถัง "
"หรือระบบต่อต้านจรวดของเรือรบเท่านั้น\n"
"\n"
"แต่ตอนนี้เราที่ PHALANX สามารถสร้างเลเซอร์ได้ในขนาดย่อส่วน "
"แม้ว่าจะมีขนาดเล็กแต่มันก็มีศักยภาพในการรองรับปฏิกริยา ดิวเทอเรียม-ฟลูออไรด์ "
"ได้เต็มที่และยังสามารถจำกัดของเสียที่เกิดขึ้นโดยไม่มีผลกระทบด้านการปนเปื้อนด้วย "
"ผมขออธิบายระบบทำงานภายในโดยย่อ\n"
"\n"
"ภายในห้องสันดาป เอธิลีนจะถูกเผาไหม้ด้วยไนโตรเจน ไทรฟลูออไรด์ ปฏิกริยานี้จะสร้างอนุภาคฟลูออรีน "
"ซึ่งอนุภาคนี้จะถูกนำไปกระทบกับส่วนผสมของแก๊สฮีเลียมและดิวเทอเรียม "
"ดิวเทอเรียมจะสร้างปฏิกริยากับฟลูออรีน ทำให้เกิดโมเลกุลดิวเทอเรียม ฟลูออไรด์ "
"ปฏิกริยานี้ทำให้เป็นการปลดปล่อยอนุภาคในตัวแปลงกระจกภายในอาวุธ และทำให้เกิดลำแสง "
"กลุ่มเลนส์จะรวบรวมแสงและเบนทิศทางสู่เป้าที่ผู้ถือเล็ง "
"และยังช่วยปรับความเบี่ยงเบนเล็กน้อยที่เกิดจากผู้ยิงหรือเป้าหมายเคลื่อนที่ได้ด้วย "
"ส่วนแก๊สดิวเทอเรียมที่เป็นของเสียจะถูกดันเข้าสู่ระบบตัวกรองความด้ันสูงที่ออกแบบเป็นพิเศษ "
"ซึ่งจะดักโมเลกุลของเสียหรือกัมมันตภาพรังสี ก่อนที่จะปล่อยแกีสที่ไม่มีพิษส่วนที่เหลือกลับสู่บรรยากาศ\n"
"\n"
"ตัวกรองนี้ต้องถูกเปลี่ยนหลังภารกิจทุกครั้ง แต่เราได้ออกแบบให้ระบบการเปลี่ยนนั้นง่ายดายไม่ยุ่งยาก "
"หากระบบกรองเสียหายระหว่างการปฏิบัติการ อาวุธนี้จะไม่ทำงานเพื่อไม่ให้เกิดการปนเปื้อน\n"
"\n"
"แสงเลเซอร์นี้ทำงานอยู่ในความถี่อินฟาเรดระดับกลาง "
"ดังนั้นแสงนี้จะมองไม่เห็นเว้นแต่จะใส่แว่นอินฟาเรดเท่านั้น\n"
"\n"
"น่าเสียดายที่อาวุธต้นแบบที่เราสร้าง ยังไม่พร้อมจะผลิตเต็มกำลังเพื่อเป็นอาวุธสำหรับทหารราบ "
"เนื่องจากยังต้องมีการปรับแต่งและสร้างสมดุลให้เหมาะกับการใช้งานของมนุษย์ก่อน "
"แต่นวัตกรรมของเรายังสามารถนำไปประยุกต์ใช้กับอาวุธของยานพาหนะได้ -- "
"อาจแม้กระทั่งปืนของเครื่องบิน ผมได้เสนอหลายโครงการใหม่ในกล่องรับจดหมายของท่าน "
"ตามแนวคิดที่เราได้ออกแบบไว้\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "

"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "
"in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can "
"survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP "
"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "
"trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's "
"ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-"
"sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its "
"size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever we need an automatic weapon no larger than our own P-12, this is "
"the weapon that fills the gap.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine pistol the classification "
"MP-699.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MP-699 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from "
"the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond "
"to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo. It is a good alternative for soldiers "
"who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-"
"powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large "
"enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them "
"can be carried conveniently.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single MP-699 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"\n"
"The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping "
"power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It is one of "
"the heaviest and most cumbersome rifles one might legitimately call a rifle, "
"but in the hands of a trained specialist it is extraordinarily accurate.\n"

"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, "
"the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our "
"arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault "
"weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst "
"mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its "
"tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat "
"experience with it.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "
"until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of "
"effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag "
"grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are "
"placed at risk.\n"
"\n"
"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of "
"available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner "
"might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can "
"significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our "
"troops. Its utility is not to be underestimated.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"

"Medikits come with three prepared treatment capabilities. Apply First Aid "
"will treat a soldier's wounds, stemming the blood loss of a wound in an "
"effort to keep them alive. It will restore a small amount of health, but "
"soldiers will need to recover back at base.\n"
"\n"
"Stimulants can be used to revive a soldier who has fallen unconcious as a "
"result of being stunned or gassed.\n"

"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "

"Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the "
"news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate. It can't be thrown effectively because "
"its chances of achieving a seal are very low. Planting one by hand has a "
"much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while "
"wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. "
"All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before "
"it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of "
"things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own "

"Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the "
"news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a "
"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its "
"chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand "
"has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops "
"while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in "
"danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the "
"target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of "
"things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own "
"lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, "
"sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a "
"ratio that neither PHALANX nor humanity can possibly afford. Even if it was "
"closer to 10: 1 I still wouldn't fancy our chances. After all, how many of "
"them are there?\n"
"\n"
"I wish we'd never found the damned thing. I don't like where this war is "
"going.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "

"We've got design documents in place for your engineers to build new ammo "
"cartridges for the Assault Rifle, Machine Gun and SR-1 Sniper Rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The Encased Plasma Ammo is essentially a shape charge miniaturized to fit "
"inside of a traditional rifle. It consists of a small plasma core, a tip "
"that fragments on impact and a soft outer casing. When the bullet hits its "
"target, the tip fragments and the small plasma core slams into the armour. "

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared "
"a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
"rifle, but an unusual one. Like a machine gun, it is designed to saturate a "
"target with projectiles, but it takes this concept much further. It vomits "
"out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
"easily tear apart a target.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, "
"hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute "
"into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for "
"as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike "
"bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to "
"target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low "
"in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing. They are easily "
"knocked off course for the same reason, but so many needles are put down "
"range that even distant shots are likely to make some contact with the "
"enemy.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
"electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
"coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too "
"energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made "
"it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We "
"may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research. I've "
"put a new research proposal in your queue along these lines.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler's electromagnet array makes it much heavier than the average "
"rifle, which could reduce the effectiveness of some of our troops. But given "
"its deadly power, I'm sure more than a few of our boys will gladly shed some "
"other equipment to carry the Needler into battle.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "
"needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious "
"casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler "
"is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to "

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short "
"range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. "
"It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms "
"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "

"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows repeated shots without losing "
"control.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is not as effective at very great distance, but for a PHALANX squad's "
"typical short-range skirmishing, this should not become a problem.\n"
"\n"
"The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. "
"Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than "
"any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require.\n"

"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1 should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; it is too unwieldy to fire off quick snap shots with any accuracy. "
"Marksmen should assume a crouched firing position for extra stability "
"whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user. The stun rod is "
"more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. "
"Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"

"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "

"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"

"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy "
"assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and "
"light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "
"It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien "
"positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from "
"all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault "
"weapon.\n"
"\n"
"It should be a prime candidate for any soldier with heavy weapons training.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"None."

"aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four "
"HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The "
"HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered "
"aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount "
"anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also "
"carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a "
"cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "
"Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-"
"wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all "
"over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
"deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
"respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
"recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and "
"to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will "
"immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will "
"secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure "
"delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important "
"because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a "
"problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien "
"technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated "
"fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO "
"sighting.\n"

"ท่านผู้บัญชาการ, ทีมของผมทำการวิเคราะห์จานบินเล็กที่เราจับได้เสร็จสิ้น "
"มันเป็นสิ่งมหัศจรรย์ทางวิศวกรรม และเรากำลังตั้งตารอที่จะมีโอกาสในการนำวิทยาการที่ดีนี้มาลองใช้\n"
"\n"
"โครงสร้างแปลกประหลาดของยานนั้นสร้างปัญหาที่เราต้องค้นหาคำตอบ "
"การออกแบบดูไม่สมเหตุผลหากมองจากพื้นดิน แต่เมื่อเราได้มอง \"ใต้กระโปรง\" "
"และทดสอบวัสดุห้องเครื่องในสภาพห้องวิจัย เราไ้ด้เข้าใจความสามารถของจานบินมากขึ้น "
"ผมได้ทำรายการของการค้นพบที่สำคัญดังนี้\n"
"\n"
"- ระบบขับเคลื่อนเป็นเครื่องยนต์จรวดที่ไม่เหมือนกับของโลก มันใช้การทำลายตัวระหว่าง สสาร-"
"แอนทายแมทเทอร์ เพื่อสร้างแรงส่ง โดยการใส่โปรตอนและแอนทายโปรตอนเข้าในห้องสันดาป "
"แล้วดันพลังระเบิดออกไปหลังเครื่อง ทำให้จานบินมีพลังมากและไม่ต้องใช้อากาศหรือก๊าซอื่นๆ "
"ในการทำสันดาป ทำให้มันสามารถจุดระเบิดได้ในสูญญากาศ "
"มีระบบหล่อเย็นแบบทันสมัยที่จะฉีดไนโตรเจนเหลวผ่านเครื่องยนต์ภายนอกเพื่อให้เครื่องเย็นและลดอินฟาเรด "
"ความร้อนสะสมของเครื่องยนต์ยังนำไปใช้ในการผลิตไฟฟ้าในยานด้วย\n"
"\n"
"- เราไม่พบเครื่องมือการลงจอด หรือเครื่องมือการลอยตัวเหนือพื้นดินในยานบินนี้ "
"ซึ่งหมายความว่ามันไม่ได้ถูกออกแบบให้ลงจอด หากมันสูญเสียเครื่องทั้งสองข้าง มันจะตก\n"
"\n"
"- ถังเชื้อเพลิงมีขนาดเล็กมาก, วัดกันได้ไม่ถึงหนึ่งกรัม "
"แต่ผมแทบจะหัวใจวายเมื่อพบว่ามีอะไรอยู่ในนั้้นบ้าง การบรรจุเต็มถังที่ 2/10 กรัม "
"ซึ่งสามารถสร้างแรงระเบิดได้มากกว่า 8 กิโลตัน โดยเปรียบเทียบแล้วระเบิดที่ฮิโรชิมานั้นมีขนาด 13 "
"กิโลตัน แน่นอนว่าถังนี้ถูกเสริมเกราะและติดตั้งอยู่ลึกที่สุดที่เป็นไปได้ "
"และมีกลไกที่จะดีดถังทิ้งในกรณีฉุกเฉิน แต่ก็ไม่สมบูรณ์แบบ "
"การโจมตีโดนถังโดยตรงหรือระบบกักกันจะทำให้เกิดการระเบิด "
"แรงระเบิดส่วนใหญ่จะถูกกักอยู่ในโครงสร้างจานบิน แต่การระเบิดนี้ก็เป็นภัยกับยานขับไล่ของเรา "
"ข้อดีเพียงอย่างเดียวก็คือการระเบิดของแอนทายแมทเทอร์นั้นสร้างกัมมันตภาพรังสีเพียงเล็กน้อยหรือไ่ม่มีเลย\n"
"\n"
"- ยานนี้ตรวจจับด้วยอุปกรณ์ของเราได้ยาก เนื่องจากโครงสร้างตัวถังที่ดูดซับรังสี "
"แต่เราก็ได้ผลดีกว่าด้วยการตรวจรังสีอินฟาเรดและรังสีแกมม่า "
"เพราะเครื่องยนต์แอนทายแมทเทอร์นั้นสร้างรังสีดังกล่าวออกมามาก\n"
"\n"
"- การออกแบบให้บาง (ทำให้มีการยกตัวไม่ดีและทำให้บังคับกลางอากาศได้ยาก) "
"ส่วนหนึ่งมาจากน้ำหนักมหาศาลของวัสดุตัวถัง น้ำหนักส่วนเกินถูกเอาออกหมด "
"และยานก็บินเร็วพอที่จะไม่ต้องพึ่งปีกมาก วัสดุนี้น่าทึ่งเพราะเป็นวัสดุผสมของโลหะกับพลาสติกโพลีเมอร์ "
"มันยังเป็นโลหะผสมแบบมีความจำ ที่จะ \"จดจำ\" รูปร่างได้อย่างน้อยสองแบบ "
"จะหดมาเป็นรูปร่างขนาดย่อมเมื่อเย็นตัว แต่จะขยายตัวและกลายสภาพพร้อมบินเมื่อมีความร้อน "
"วัสดุนี้แข็งแกร่งกว่าทุกสิ่งที่เรารู้จัก เราต้องวิจัยสิ่งนี้เพิ่มเติม\n"
"\n"
"- เราประเมินว่ายานนี้ไม่มีอาวุธ แต่มันติดสิ่งที่เป็นระบบเซนเซอร์ขนาดใหญ่สี่ทิศทางรอบห้องบังคับ "
"ที่น่าสนใจคือมันไม่ได้ติดอุปกรณ์สื่อสารอะไรเลย ซึ่งนั่นก็ดูจะขัดกับบทบาทที่แน่ชัดในฐานะยานสอดแนม "
"ตอนนี้เราทั้งหมดก็คงได้แต่เดากัน\n"
"\n"
"เราเรียกยานประเภทนี้ว่า \"ยานสอดแนม\" เพราะมันดูจะเข้ากับัตถุประสงค์ของยาน "
"โดยส่วนใหญ่มันถูกใช้เป็นยานเก็บข้อมูล และยานแนวหน้าในการสอดแนมก่อนการบุกของยานขนาดใหญ่ "
"แม้ว่าจะไม่มีอาวุธ เราก็ยังควรจะทำลายยานเหล่านี้หากเราิติดภาระอื่น "
"เพราะอะไรก็ตามที่พวกต่างดาวทำก็เป็นสิ่งไม่ดีของเราทั้งนั้น\n"

#~ "Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"

#~ "Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
#~ "Operations Command\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
#~ "technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
#~ "Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
#~ "record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've "
#~ "managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
#~ "advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
#~ "size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
#~ "magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
#~ "overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
#~ "caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive "
#~ "armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does "
#~ "not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for "
#~ "long-range firefights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other "
#~ "rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. "
#~ "Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to "
#~ "break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at "
#~ "once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the "
#~ "design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. "
#~ "This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
#~ "down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
#~ "than any pistol or SMG.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is "
#~ "the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for "
#~ "us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle "
#~ "remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in "
#~ "tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at "
#~ "these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any "
#~ "sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while "
#~ "rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second "
#~ "assault wave to support the others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, "
#~ "they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively "
#~ "bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
#~ "advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Addenda\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
#~ "fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
#~ "weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

#~ "\n"
#~ "I've found some disturbing new information during our continued research "
#~ "into the XVI organism. I have reason to believe that XVI may be an even "
#~ "larger part of the alien plan than we first suspected.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "First, some background. During our initial analyses of the aliens' "
#~ "cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA "
#~ "replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We "
#~ "initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to "
#~ "appear with unerring regularity. The same result, again and again; every "
#~ "time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have "
#~ "difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. It didn't make "
#~ "any sense until our recent discovery of the XVI infection in civilian "
#~ "people. I immediately suspected a correlation but wanted to wait until I "
#~ "could prove it, and since then I've spent most of my off hours studying "
#~ "the problem. Now I believe I've found the cause -- XVI itself.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I've determined that all the aliens carry their own versions of this same "
#~ "micro-organic infection. There are differences to account for the "
#~ "different bodies and blood types -- some of these varieties don't appear "
#~ "to live in blood at all -- but it is unmistakably the same thing. We can "
#~ "only assume that the different strands of the infection were engineered "
#~ "to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Since all the alien species carry a unique strand of the infection, I've "
#~ "decided to modify our naming conventions slightly, giving individual XVI "
#~ "strands alphabetical designations after the source in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Humans have XVI-H, Tamans have XVI-T, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The organism's function is not readily apparent in these aliens since we "
#~ "have no uninfected control specimens against which we can measure the "
#~ "effect. However, given this information, we have to conclude that XVI is "
#~ "more than simply a bio-weapon against humanity. It may even be used in a "
#~ "similar way -- an enslavement device suppressing individual thought and "
#~ "linking the subject into the group mind, whether there is a group or not. "
#~ "Perhaps the aliens that are sent to Earth are all members of some sort of "
#~ "slave soldier caste, or even prisoners forced to fight, like the Red "
#~ "Army's convict battalions in World War 2. At this point we can barely "
#~ "begin to speculate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I think we should pursue aggressive investigation into XVI so "
#~ "that we can find the truth behind some of these mysteries. We have to "
#~ "determine the true purpose of this organism, what it means to the war and "
#~ "to us as a species. XVI-H is possibly the biggest threat we've ever "
#~ "faced.\n"

#~ "give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we "
#~ "encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due "
#~ "to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human "
#~ "error, but the problem has continued to appear with surprising "

#~ "single uncontaminated sequence. I spent some of my off hours studying the "
#~ "problem, and I believe I've found the cause.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in "
#~ "our blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences "
#~ "can be found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has "
#~ "confirmed that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species "
#~ "we've recovered. The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular "
#~ "organism present in huge numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are "
#~ "several versions of it, one for each species of alien, and they all share "
#~ "remarkable DNA similarities. Interestingly, although these organisms all "
#~ "have an identical number of chromosomes, none of them can survive in a "
#~ "body that is not a member of its source species. Also curious is the fact "
#~ "that there are absolutely no variations in DNA between organisms of the "
#~ "same version. This leads us to believe that the different versions may "
#~ "have been engineered -- wholly or in part -- to suit the individual "
#~ "species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
#~ "infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run "
#~ "tests on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control "
#~ "specimens. The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative "
#~ "effects -- or positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's "
#~ "presence. They are essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. "
#~ "Since the organism requires a living host for its own survival, it seems "
#~ "to be either a parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved "
#~ "benefits.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or "
#~ "XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is "
#~ "far more complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates "
#~ "exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien "
#~ "species carries a unique strand of the infection, we have given them "
#~ "alphabetical designations after the source species in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the "
#~ "only thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together "
#~ "physically. We can only assume that new strands of the infection were "
#~ "engineered to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When "
#~ "injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have "
#~ "observed the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. "
#~ "Unexpectedly, however, any trace of the infection was subsequently "
#~ "annihilated by standard human T cells. The organism was unable to "
#~ "deactivate our immune system in order to take root.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our "
#~ "soldiers on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep "
#~ "you updated about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our "
#~ "personnel is in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine "

#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
#~ "technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
#~ "Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
#~ "record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've "
#~ "managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
#~ "advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
#~ "size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
#~ "magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
#~ "overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
#~ "caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive "
#~ "armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does "
#~ "not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for "
#~ "long-range firefights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other "
#~ "rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. "
#~ "Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to "
#~ "break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at "
#~ "once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the "
#~ "design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. "
#~ "This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
#~ "down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
#~ "than any pistol or SMG.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is "
#~ "the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for "
#~ "us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle "
#~ "remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in "
#~ "tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at "
#~ "these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any "
#~ "sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while "
#~ "rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second "
#~ "assault wave to support the others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, "
#~ "they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively "
#~ "bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
#~ "advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Addenda\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
#~ "fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
#~ "weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

#~ "Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma "
#~ "weapon family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The "
#~ "blaster requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in "
#~ "and out of secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop "
#~ "with great strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it "
#~ "were a vehicle-mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. "
#~ "The magazines weigh nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated "
#~ "is hot enough to melt through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
#~ "increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
#~ "bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
#~ "distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but "
#~ "the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma "
#~ "chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per "
#~ "minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased "
#~ "thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly "
#~ "even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at "
#~ "all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that "
#~ "any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an "
#~ "extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine "
#~ "gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use "
#~ "is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like "
#~ "most humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one "
#~ "and require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/"
#~ "or the development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the "
#~ "blaster's inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which "
#~ "is documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able "
#~ "to train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "
#~ "provided they're able to lift it.\n"

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
#~ "technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
#~ "Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
#~ "record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've "
#~ "managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
#~ "that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
#~ "especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place "
#~ "at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
#~ "chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat "
#~ "package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; "
#~ "the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed "
#~ "for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-"
#~ "breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt "
#~ "the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of "
#~ "shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can "
#~ "protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, "
#~ "the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a "
#~ "tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to "
#~ "fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow "
#~ "the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm "
#~ "centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- "
#~ "solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition "
#~ "has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently "
#~ "against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after "
#~ "penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small "
#~ "projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and "
#~ "other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with "
#~ "these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among "
#~ "the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range "
#~ "than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, "
#~ "providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power "
#~ "as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be "
#~ "effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled "
#~ "slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to "
#~ "wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't "
#~ "expect it to be very effective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
#~ "has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. "
#~ "However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The "
#~ "CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-"
#~ "generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight "
#~ "tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be "
#~ "the finest piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
#~ "Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
#~ "pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
#~ "turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at "
#~ "supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a "
#~ "sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in "
#~ "front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to "
#~ "harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the "
#~ "heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours "
#~ "before burning through all their fuel.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
#~ "deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to "
#~ "Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and "
#~ "a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto "
#~ "well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise "
#~ "ability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
#~ "the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its "
#~ "hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the "
#~ "target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and "
#~ "acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even "
#~ "complete.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. "
#~ "The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a "
#~ "state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- "
#~ "but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar "
#~ "system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM "
#~ "emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off "
#~ "missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints "
#~ "can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to "
#~ "accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a "
#~ "premium.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "
#~ "Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, "
#~ "its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, "
#~ "within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "
#~ "recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been "
#~ "described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
#~ "deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium "
#~ "wing mounts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that "
#~ "threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe "
#~ "with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be "
#~ "deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its "
#~ "hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the "
#~ "flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the "
#~ "combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, "
#~ "but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat "
#~ "comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the "
#~ "human race is in trouble.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Addenda\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in "
#~ "person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these "
#~ "little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold "
#~ "they held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is "
#~ "probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack "
#~ "helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. "
#~ "It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially "
#~ "at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech "
#~ "assessment. However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even "
#~ "better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's "

#~ "\n"
#~ "This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed "
#~ "specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien "
#~ "harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs "
#~ "and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL "
#~ "(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's "
#~ "crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they "
#~ "return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to "
#~ "wherever it is they came from.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being "
#~ "the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster "
#~ "than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more "
#~ "antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, "
#~ "thicker armour on the fuel tank, and more effective emergency antimatter-"
#~ "dumping measures. Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will "
#~ "be contained by the UFO's extremely strong construction.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and "
#~ "possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when "
#~ "full.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around "
#~ "the craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam "
#~ "weapon we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an "
#~ "interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly "
#~ "sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by matter-antimatter "
#~ "reaction rockets similar to UFO engines. These missiles are insanely "
#~ "fast, so fast that they don't need explosive warheads to kill their prey, "
#~ "relying solely on kinetic impact and the sympathetic detonation of any "
#~ "remaining fuel. More research into this weapon will be a high priority.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-"
#~ "priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, "
#~ "its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. "
#~ "Its only obvious flaw is a significant drop in manoeuvrability from the "
#~ "Scout and Fighter models. Our interceptors are significantly more agile "
#~ "and we have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the "
#~ "aliens do. This is one of the few advantages we'll have against the "
#~ "Harvester, and it would be wise to upgrade our equipment in order to "
#~ "mitigate some of the aliens' tech superiority.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on any and all "
#~ "Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then "
#~ "should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our analysis of the Harvester's increased capabilities over the Scout "
#~ "raises some frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually "
#~ "grow faster as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt "
#~ "that, if they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and "

#~ "Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, "
#~ "but even so I nearly had a heart attack when I found out what was in "
#~ "there. The maximum load -- two tenths of a gramme -- could create a blast "
#~ "yield of more than 8 kilotons. By comparison the bomb at Hiroshima was 13 "
#~ "kilotons. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible "
#~ "within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison "
#~ "the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the "
#~ "tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of "
#~ "the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any "
#~ "explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only "
#~ "saving grace is that antimatter explosions create little to no "
#~ "radioactive fallout.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- The craft is extremely hard to see with our detection equipment. This "

#~ "kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with infrared and gamma ray "
#~ "detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- The slim design (generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
#~ "air) is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. Every "
#~ "gramme of excess matter has been stripped, and the craft moves fast "
#~ "enough to need very little wing surface. The material itself is quite "

#~ "I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our "
#~ "ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. "
#~ "Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "
#~ "learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign "
#~ "language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and "
#~ "instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign "
#~ "language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on "
#~ "trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been "
#~ "easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical "
#~ "encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The "
#~ "casualty rate has been high.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems "
#~ "to have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We"
#~ "\", or even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as "
#~ "numerical differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a "
#~ "group. This indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien "
#~ "thinking. The shared consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a "
#~ "single enclosed entity; it merely is. This, along with various other "
#~ "answers we've pieced together from our continued sessions, leads us to "
#~ "believe that all aliens do indeed share one single mind. And I mean all "
#~ "of them, Commander. It's not simply a means of increasing team efficiency "
#~ "or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an indispensible component of alien "
#~ "society. Every alien that lives and breathes is an equal and identical "
#~ "part of the greater hive mind, even specimens of completely different "
#~ "species. The only diversity the aliens will acknowledge is in the "
#~ "different substances required to keep the various species alive.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to "
#~ "communicate with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude "
#~ "as sign language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have "
#~ "a deep conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell "
#~ "in your own body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien "
#~ "ears and brain really are.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
#~ "part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
#~ "homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their "
#~ "mission to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this "
#~ "is due to distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been "
#~ "able to tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I "
#~ "would like to request your permission to look into methods we could use "
#~ "to more effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we "
#~ "require a healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace "
#~ "losses. We have to maintain the isolated hive mind we have in "
#~ "Containment. Losing it now would be a significant setback to our "
#~ "research.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "(Odd Behaviour)\"There are several species of alien, all of which meet "

#~ "linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue "
#~ "of inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\"\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Dr. Yamamura is beginning to make real progress on this front, teaching "

#~ "conclusions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
#~ "larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
#~ "alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the "
#~ "child-sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
#~ "from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer "
#~ "turned out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing "
#~ "the aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres "
#~ "as well. Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these "
#~ "devices, all with the same basic functionality, implying that their "
#~ "constant operation is either required for survival on the alien homeworld "
#~ "or that we are seeing only specimens which are intended for frequent "
#~ "planetary operations. Certainly external breathing apparatus would be "
#~ "easier and more economical to use if these specimens were only intended "
#~ "to take short trips into hostile atmospheres.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
#~ "subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either "
#~ "side of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. "
#~ "These tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
#~ "functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter "
#~ "mechanism is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that "
#~ "are harmful to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass "
#~ "through. The tanks are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the "
#~ "back of the alien's neck.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate "
#~ "data on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that "
#~ "we believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our "
#~ "Containment unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, "
#~ "very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If "
#~ "all of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, "
#~ "some of our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure "
#~ "methane.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
#~ "Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
#~ "these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
#~ "now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
#~ "they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
#~ "usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should "

#~ "\n"
#~ "We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
#~ "core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
#~ "specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
#~ "course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
#~ "astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use "
#~ "of this alien hardware.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
#~ "astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
#~ "system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
#~ "intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel "
#~ "time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. "
#~ "These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the "
#~ "exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-"
#~ "light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the "
#~ "theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL "
#~ "technology.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a "
#~ "star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We "
#~ "have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. "
#~ "Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would "
#~ "surely need it for navigation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered "
#~ "so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface "
#~ "maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-"
#~ "undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the "
#~ "asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every "
#~ "body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're "
#~ "not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will "
#~ "greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- "
#~ "whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, "
#~ "but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be "
#~ "compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar "
#~ "travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in "
#~ "the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the "
#~ "solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into "
#~ "space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary "
#~ "travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or "
#~ "even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"

#~ "จานบินต้องมีการถอดประกอบมากกว่าจะพอเก็บในโรงเก็บของ "

#~ "การทำงานในจุดปฏิบัติการนั้นไม่ควรอย่างยิ่ง "
#~ "เพราะมันอาจมีอันตรายกับสุขภาพของนักวิทยาศาสตร์และวิศวกร มันอาจดึงดูดพวกคนที่จะมาโขมยของ "
#~ "และมันจะมีผลกระทบต่อความปลอดภัยและความลับของภารกิจเรา\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "ความสำคัญของการศึกษาจานบินที่เก็บได้นั้นเด่นชัด "
#~ "มันจะให้ความรู้เกี่ยวกับระบบและจุดอ่อนของยานต่างดาว "
#~ "และอาจค้นพบเทคนิคใหม่ในการพัฒนาประสิทธิภาพของยานเรา เมื่อจานบินพร้อมขนย้าย "
#~ "เราจะใช้เฮลิคอปเตอร์ขนย้ายเข้าฐาน PHALANX "
#~ "การเก็บกู้นั้นจะกระทำโดยหน่วยงานสหประชาชาติในพื้นที่ เพื่อช่วยบรรเทาภาระของเรา\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "โรงเก็บจานบินใหญ่จะเก็บยานต่างดาวขนาดพอสมควรได้ "

#~ "หากทำงานตามกระบวนการนี้ โรงเก็บจานบินจะมีความสำคัญทางกลยุทธ์เล็กน้อยสำหรับผู้โจมตี "
#~ "และไม่น่าจะได้รับความสนใจเว้นแต่โจมตีตามโอกาส การป้องกันไม่ให้เราถอดประกอบจานบิน "

#~ "ด้วยขนาดที่บุคคลสามารถพกพาได้\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "วิธีการที่ได้ผลนั้นไม่ใช่การพยายามสร้างแบตเตอรี่ขนาดใหญ่ให้เสียเวลา "

#~ "เลเซอร์เคมีนี้มีการใช้มาเป็นเวลานานแล้ว "
#~ "และเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของโครงการทดลองอาวุธตั้งแ่ต่ปลายศตวรรษที่ 20 แต่ก็มักประสบปัญหา "

#~ "ภายในห้องสันดาป เอธิลีนจะถูกเผาไหม้ด้วยไนโตรเจน ไทรฟลูออไรด์ "

#~ "ดิวเทอเรียมจะสร้างปฏิกริยากับฟลูออรีน ทำให้เกิดโมเลกุลดิวเทอเรียม ฟลูออไรด์ "
#~ "ปฏิกริยานี้ทำให้เป็นการปลดปล่อยอนุภาคในตัวแปลงกระจกภายในอาวุธ และทำให้เกิดลำแสง "
#~ "กลุ่มเลนส์จะรวบรวมแสงและเบนทิศทางสู่เป้าที่ผู้ถือเล็ง "
#~ "และยังช่วยปรับความเบี่ยงเบนเล็กน้อยที่เกิดจากผู้ยิงหรือเป้าหมายเคลื่อนที่ได้ด้วย "
#~ "ส่วนแก๊สดิวเทอเรียมที่เป็นของเสียจะถูกดันเข้าสู่ระบบตัวกรองความด้ันสูงที่ออกแบบเป็นพิเศษ "
#~ "ซึ่งจะดักโมเลกุลของเสียหรือกัมมันตภาพรังสี ก่อนที่จะปล่อยแกีสที่ไม่มีพิษส่วนที่เหลือกลับสู่บรรยากาศ\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "ตัวกรองนี้ต้องถูกเปลี่ยนหลังภารกิจทุกครั้ง แต่เราได้ออกแบบให้ระบบการเปลี่ยนนั้นง่ายดายไม่ยุ่งยาก "
#~ "หากระบบกรองเสียหายระหว่างการปฏิบัติการ อาวุธนี้จะไม่ทำงานเพื่อไม่ให้เกิดการปนเปื้อน\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "แสงเลเซอร์นี้ทำงานอยู่ในความถี่อินฟาเรดระดับกลาง "
#~ "ดังนั้นแสงนี้จะมองไม่เห็นเว้นแต่จะใส่แว่นอินฟาเรดเท่านั้น\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "น่าเสียดายที่อาวุธต้นแบบที่เราสร้าง ยังไม่พร้อมจะผลิตเต็มกำลังเพื่อเป็นอาวุธสำหรับทหารราบ "
#~ "เนื่องจากยังต้องมีการปรับแต่งและสร้างสมดุลให้เหมาะกับการใช้งานของมนุษย์ก่อน "
#~ "แต่นวัตกรรมของเรายังสามารถนำไปประยุกต์ใช้กับอาวุธของยานพาหนะได้ -- "
#~ "อาจแม้กระทั่งปืนของเครื่องบิน ผมได้เสนอหลายโครงการใหม่ในกล่องรับจดหมายของท่าน "

#~ "The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests "

#~ "performance levels and operational details.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests "
#~ "are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small "
#~ "police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will "
#~ "perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for "
#~ "containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't "
#~ "think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the "
#~ "census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. "
#~ "99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national "
#~ "authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves "
#~ "several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures "
#~ "that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we "
#~ "generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for "
#~ "identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping "
#~ "track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we "
#~ "need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to "
#~ "shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the "
#~ "equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the "
#~ "reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information "
#~ "will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of "
#~ "infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This "
#~ "will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us "
#~ "where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the "
#~ "situation becomes critical.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with "
#~ "additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts "
#~ "by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity "
#~ "reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme "

#~ "operations. The pod contains a total of 128 very small, very fast rockets "
#~ "with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one "
#~ "considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground "
#~ "targets until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their "
#~ "potential.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had "
#~ "been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in "
#~ "for the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the "
#~ "pilot had left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a "
#~ "suicide run with full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs "
#~ "out of the sky with rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-"
#~ "land. He returned to his airbase two days later without a scratch on "
#~ "him.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that "
#~ "they can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the "
#~ "rockets are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each "
#~ "tube, and fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so "
#~ "fast that all eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before "
#~ "the first rocket actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate "
#~ "of fire, the pod can fire all 128 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this "
#~ "is usually throttled back to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low "
#~ "accuracy of any single volley.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and "
#~ "greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited "
#~ "compared to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod "
#~ "is unlikely to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving "
#~ "UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow. "
#~ "In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, tearing "
#~ "mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster "
#~ "opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single "
#~ "round on the target.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and "
#~ "mostly in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a "
#~ "single UFO with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target "
#~ "into his wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which "
#~ "point the wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more "
#~ "than a single TR-20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum "
#~ "air-to-air efficiency.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If the mission target is stationary or ground-based, these rockets will "
#~ "be ideal for softening up any defences and defenders before a tactical "
#~ "mission.\n"

#~ "This is a TR-20 unguided rocket. It is designed to be loaded into the "
#~ "TR-20 Rocket Pod.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The TR-20 rocket is essentially a very small, very fast plastic dart "
#~ "moulded around a rod of depleted uranium. It is fin-stabilised and "
#~ "powered by a cheap solid-fuel rocket engine, a civilian model which is "
#~ "also popular in amateur rocketry. One of these engines is capable of "
#~ "propelling an amateur rocket eight kilometres into the sky. It's also "
#~ "capable of propelling a heavy DU penetrator into a fighter jet and out "
#~ "the other side.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Due to its weight, the TR-20 rocket has a maximum effective range of 4 "
#~ "kilometres, after which the fuel runs out and the rocket rapidly loses "
#~ "power.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The individual rockets weigh approximately 4 kilos. A fully-loaded pod is "

#~ "The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range "
