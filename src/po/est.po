"Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
"succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
"achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
"battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to "
"lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical "
"lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of "
"experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have "
"always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real "
"military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman "
"to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to "
"those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
"miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
"deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without "
"danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner "
"workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement "
"by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our "
"custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or "
"radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back "
"into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the "
"system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow "
"damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop "
"functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
"beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
"required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied "
"to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new "
"proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Our collected UN research files have yielded a lot of valuable information "

"Energy Weapons), weapons that transfers energy to a target by means other "
"than a projectile. We are particularly interested in the files on Continuous "
"Wave Lasers.\n"
"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers "
"over the years, but no one has ever been able to create a laser that's man-"
"portable and has a power output high enough to compete with ordinary "
"firearms. Now, however, we've been given access to all this combined "

"\n"
"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to "
"our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these "
"mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies "
"seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"
"\n"
"My team and I are all looking forward to finally getting our hands on a live "
"one, Commander.\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've recieved the first good results in our "
"ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. "
"Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "
"learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign "
"language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and "
"instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign "
"language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on "
"trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been "
"easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical "
"encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The "
"casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to "
"have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or "
"even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical "
"differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This "
"indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared "
"consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it "
"merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from "
"our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share "
"one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means "
"of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an "
"indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and "
"breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even "
"specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens "
"will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various "
"species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate "
"with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign "
"language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep "
"conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own "
"body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain "
"really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
"part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
"homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission "
"to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to "
"distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to "
"tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would "
"like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more "
"effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a "
"healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to "

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "

"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are "

"arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and "

"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% "

"been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien "
"activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress "
"we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder "
"the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment "

"personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped "

"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection "

"conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien "
"activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes "
"critical.\n"

"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Despite good penetration against organics, this weapon performs very poorly "
"against robotic targets."

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used "
"in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can "
"survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP "
"pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a "
"longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater "
"kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of "
"firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round "
"detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round "
"burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through "
"kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round "
"tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of "
"trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's "
"ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-"
"sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its "
"size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever we need an automatic weapon no larger than our own P-12, this is "
"the weapon that fills the gap.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine pistol the classification MP-"
"699.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MP-699 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from "
"the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond "
"to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo. It is a good alternative for soldiers "
"who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-"
"powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large "
"enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them "
"can be carried conveniently.\n"

"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "
"a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "
"contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy "
"assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and "
"light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "
"Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between "
"Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine "
"gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire "
"when and where they need it most.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine gun the classification MG12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. "
"It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien "
"positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from "
"all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault "
"weapon.\n"
"\n"
"It should be a prime candidate for any soldier with heavy weapons training.\n"

"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a "
"classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It "
"is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-"
"tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into "
"hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is "
"fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of "
"Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually "
"turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW "
"(Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that "
"ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type "
"of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, "
"another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been "
"able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against "
"the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- "
"because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired "
"out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum "
"effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three "
"parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity "
"allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous "
"situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate "
"anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an "
"MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, "
"AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS "
"ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of "
"the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create "

"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our "
"assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care "
"should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could "
"have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during "
"firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The "
"HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. "
"Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to "
"the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 "
"metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat "
"knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "
"human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. "
"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, "
"the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our "
"arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault "
"weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst "
"mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its "
"tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat "
"experience with it.\n"

"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "

"The combat knife is a solid, twenty-six centimetre bar of sharp steel that "

"piercing power, and it is balanced for throwing should the need arise. It "
"also has a bayonet ring for affixing the knife to the barrel of an old-style "
"battle rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The inclusion of the combat knife in our arsenal was a subject of hot "
"debate. Mumbai has taught us that even in the most favourable conditions, a "
"knife is no match for the aliens' weaponry. If a knife-equipped soldier "
"isn't shot down before he even reaches his target, he will almost certainly "
"be gutted by one of the wicked alien blades that slice right through armour. "
"Only in a handful of occasions have experienced knife-fighters been able to "
"win out against alien opponents.\n"
"\n"
"Still, the combat knife has saved many a life over the years when firearms "
"became inoperable or ran out of ammo. It has never been rendered obsolete by "
"centuries of progressing technology; even the aliens use bladed weapons. "
"When the chips are down, a knife in hand is still vastly better than a man's "

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade "
"materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and "
"have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd "
"figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we "
"ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape "
"into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade "
"with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be "
"used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half "
"during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until "
"we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a "
"function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands "
"during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, "
"which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a "
"particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to "
"completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it "
"to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you "
"ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and "
"Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. "
"The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself "
"to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the "
"triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced "
"plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when "
"they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat "
"knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's "
"sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two "
"weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in "
"lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a "
"sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee "
"combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"materials used in their construction.\n"

"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the "

"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance "
"troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of "
"the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a "
"soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses "
"or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the "
"feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to "
"make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, "
"then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, "
"one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten "
"sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The "
"backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special "
"fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, "
"creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a "
"fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts "
"horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees "
"celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it "
"leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding "
"area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly "

"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "

"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "

"An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and "
"possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus "
"coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all "
"directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. "
"The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the "
"handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a "
"period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of "
"the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 "
"solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer "
"of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more "
"shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is "
"smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to "
"make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core "
"may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to "
"work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important "
"attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Though quite effective against enemy infantry, frag grenades are weapons of "
"opportunity, not a replacement for firearms or portable artillery. Their "
"range is highly limited and their casualty radius is small. However, if the "
"situation calls for close-range indirect fire or something deadly thrown "
"around a corner, the frag grenade is just the thing.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in "
"the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is "
"strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be "
"equipped with at least one grenade of some variety -- be it a frag grenade, "
"flashbang, incendiary grenade or other -- in case the need should arise. Two "
"or more are strongly recommended.\n"

"Incendiary grenades are area-denial weapons, covering a large stretch of "

"thrown, the body of the grenade explodes, spreading the incendiary compound "
"over the surrounding area -- and anyone unlucky enough to be inside the area "

"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it "

"\n"
"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. "
"In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous "
"wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and "
"far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine "
"have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's "
"very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. "
"It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire "
"or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It "
"can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of "
"continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on "
"hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of "
"material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to "
"be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, "
"and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's "
"standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the "
"last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of "
"swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on "
"the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a "
"nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the "
"darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls "
"present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of "
"course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of "
"civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. "
"Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness "
"will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles "
"limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, "
"causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as "
"long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some "
"aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection "
"range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up "
"on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching "
"threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance "
"exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. "
"However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 "
"Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. "
"It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an "
"engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man "
"equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for "
"maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "
"plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes "
"through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold "
"open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned "
"valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far "
"more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as "
"well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can "
"adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit "
"into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a "
"soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a "
"knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close "
"in terms of power.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this "
"message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working "
"on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm "
"very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working "
"laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my "
"report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium "
"fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste "
"gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down "
"even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the "
"smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as "
"our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-"
"strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a "
"period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to "
"inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate "
"the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through "
"clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or "
"immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything "
"given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's "
"very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can "
"adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus "
"particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy "
"inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use "
"two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges "
"which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses "
"the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower "
"rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our "
"other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't "
"powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the "
"laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy "
"that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for "
"a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to "
"the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without "
"reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"
"\n"
"We will need to have at least one D-F Cartridge on hand at all times in "
"order to be able to load and use a laser pistol.\n"

"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is "
"extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill "
"to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our "
"technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a "
"plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as "
"plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a "
"magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen "
"contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the "
"plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two "
"'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. "
"The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the "
"plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the "
"plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time "
"a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away "
"that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload "
"across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can "
"reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately "
"20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be "
"lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them "
"all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and "
"injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like "
"water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually "
"eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region "
"around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to "
"a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. "
"High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and "
"will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough "
"time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-"
"lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff "
"into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs "
"between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost "
"certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will "
"appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the "
"control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual "
"for human use. Our soldiers will now be able to employ the plasma pistol in "
"a combat scenario as they would any other weapon.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon "
"family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster "
"requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of "
"secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great "
"strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-"
"mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh "
"nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt "
"through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
"increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
"bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
"distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the "
"blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and "
"upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. "
"Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, "
"the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme "
"close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which "
"PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found "
"carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone "
"and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun "
"and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is "
"almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most "
"humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and "
"require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the "
"development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's "
"inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is "
"documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to "
"train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "
"provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to "
"kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has "
"a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no "
"visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the "
"handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several "
"centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go "
"to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which "
"hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the "
"weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There "
"is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of "
"plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and "
"shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot "
"shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or "
"flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is "
"achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving "
"grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its "
"chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand "

"a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid "
"hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast "
"zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The "
"battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The "
"trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint "
"scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. "
"A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. "
"The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds "
"that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three "
"seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core "
"of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the "
"grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical "
"orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched "
"off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-"
"velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to "
"the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast "
"radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be "
"dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard "
"human frag grenade.\n"
"\n"
"Anything caught within the area of effect will be either severely injured or "
"dead.\n"
"\n"
"We've drawn up a set of blueprints that will allow our Workshops to begin "
"immediate construction, and a manual to train our soldiers in its use. They "
"will now be able to use the plasma grenade as any other grenade in our "
"arsenal.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "
"with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "
"sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes "
"for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy "
"stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"

"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "
"despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is "
"more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in "
"particular.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "
"Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one "
"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-"
"automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of "
"the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX "
"should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced "
"accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and "
"display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps "
"the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken "
"ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any "
"shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in "
"Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"

"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This magazine contains 5 rounds of 20x140mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) "
"ammunition. It is a conventional single-column box design, and can be "
"extremely heavy due to the weight of the rounds inside. One magazine can "
"weigh up to 1 kilogramme depending on the type of ammo used. The rounds in "
"this magazine are high-quality match grade ammunition meant for heavy sniper "
"rifles; they are more accurate and expensive than ordinary HMG rounds.\n"
"\n"
"The magazine is meant to be loaded into an S-1 Sniper Rifle.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can "
"be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been "
"classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-"
"so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium "
"tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a "
"substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering "
"agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts "
"violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, "
"concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or "
"mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted "
"breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, "
"even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so "
"acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with "
"which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all "
"demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and "
"exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-"
"CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever "
"against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-"
"hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place "
"and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to "
"blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will "
"survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any "
"deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into "
"contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to "
"treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or "
"breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no "
"armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far "
"as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should "
"protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide "
"airtight coverage of the soldier's body.\n"
"\n"
"We've created a delivery system in the form of a standard throwable "
"canister. Our troops should experience no problems using this item in the "
"field.\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now "
"ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth "
"explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to "
"anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. "
"The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks "
"can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, "
"but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. "
"The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any "
"humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into "
"melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or "
"armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or "
"disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. "
"The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between "
"individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and "
"more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we "
"estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the "
"prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then "
"besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up "
"against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a "
"staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or "
"become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "
"additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will "
"require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt "
"instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in "
"the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most "
"powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts "
"to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create "
"ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are "
"still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used "
"once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power "
"cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that "
"holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe "
"this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave "
"further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I have an important technical "

"equipment for use by our field agents. I realise this falls outside the "
"responsibilities of my division. However, I've already discussed things with "
"Cdr. Navarre, and he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with me on the necessity "
"of the item in question. I had no choice but to go to straight to you with "
"the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical "
"engagements in all the weeks we've been waging this war. Now that we know "
"how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a "
"serious impediment to our biological and chemical research. We need living "
"tissue to study, performing its natural functions inside a living body, and "
"we don't have the ability to simply clone up some aliens to research. We "
"need prisoners. The sooner the better.\n"
"\n"
"That's why I would like to propose a simple but high-powered electrical "
"shock weapon, not unlike a military stun gun, designed to disable our "
"enemies without killing them. It would be a two-handed man-portable unit "
"with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which "
"should be sufficient even to disable alien robots such as the Bloodspider. "
"We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be "
"disabled long enough for our soldiers to take control of the situation and "
"secure prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our "
"soldiers and \"a throwback to the 20th century\", and refuses to endorse it. "
"He doesn't seem to understand. We have no alternative method of disabling "
"enemies at the voltages required. Commander, we need this weapon as badly as "
"we need live aliens from the field. We can't merely shoot them and hope to "
"patch one or two up again upon return to base. Even if we succeeded in that "
"mindset, my division's needs will be far, far higher than that for proper "
"research and interrogation.\n"
"\n"

"particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the "

"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of "

"magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand "
"them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, "
"with impressive armour-piercing capabilities and extreme damage potential. "
"The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot "

"PB pistol is significantly less accurate than our lasers and produce too "

"\n"
"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the "
"required physical strength. The particles leaving the barrel move at a "

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"

"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "
"silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that "
"can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are "
"sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the "
"basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the "
"Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced "
"armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else "
"not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the "
"extra mobility.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "
"production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version "
"of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. "
"Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact "
"alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we "
"already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are "
"honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery "
"needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best "
"to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the "
"soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close "
"assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and "
"explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary "
"devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric "
"temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no "
"place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he "
"roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, "

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If "
"it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to "
"the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate "
"balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the "
"medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense "
"nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. "
"In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the "
"number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates "
"are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh "
"covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over "
"mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what "
"race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy "
"that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous "
"mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the "
"weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated "
"into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and "
"we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity "
"in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against "
"lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body "
"Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens "
"wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or "
"brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still "
"overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some "
"skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will "
"remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would "
"critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense "
"nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so "
"many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, "

"\n"
"What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our "

"that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle armour. "

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here "
"is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its "
"core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with "
"specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a "
"course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of "
"astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of "
"this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the "
"astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the "
"system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can "
"intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', "
"'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters "
"can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you "
"want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when "
"plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do "
"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "
"found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs "
"with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for "
"navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "
"far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of "
"the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon "
"of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as "
"the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system "
"plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information "
"will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of "
"knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into "
"the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but "
"I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared "
"to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with "
"these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we "
"could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we "
"could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will "
"greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point "
"where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click "
"of a button.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. "
"We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally "
"understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO -- Scout)\"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine "
"unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter "
"annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into "
"the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back "
"of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other "
"gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a "
"highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through "
"the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared "
"signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are "
"constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our "
"current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use "
"them for any applications we might come up. I have to warn you, though; they "
"will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien "
"materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling "
"system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and "
"control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just "
"an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to "
"start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in "
"the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these "
"matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start "
"using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious "
"re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a "
"tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the "
"force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. "
"The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human "
"body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have "
"trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to "
"be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and "
"other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may "
"result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust "
"limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during "
"turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and "
"mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done "
"some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for "
"antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining "
"obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"The project on alien detection is complete, Commander. We now have a full "
"understanding of the machinery, its controls, and the modifications needed "
"for human use.\n"
"\n"
"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes "
"use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses "
"or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, "
"but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics "
"as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old "
"reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the "
"Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in "
"the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now "
"identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in "
"a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity "
"field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and "
"composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial "
"objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there "
"is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to "
"be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we "
"surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range "
"of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which "
"automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be "
"adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps "
"alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or "
"increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire "
"control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence "
"control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based "
"installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and "
"increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs "
"to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech "
"in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat "
"survivability of our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, it's not the immediate uses that are the most important. These "
"detectors are vital for any future PHALANX spacecraft. In space, without the "
"support of ground radar, we're going to need the extra power very badly.\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the shape will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "
"a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take "
"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"
"\n"
"Alien Materials should now be available for use in production. "
"Unfortunately, they require a lot of rare and expensive components, some of "
"which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we "
"could obtain the materials needed in quantities that would make non-trivial "
"production possible. We'll have to salvage what we need off the aliens, "
"because we won't be able to produce any of it for the forseeable future.\n"

"Commander, as I mentioned in my previous report, the UFO we recovered was "
"plated with a highly interesting alloy which blends plastic and metal "
"together into a single material. These materials seem to be used almost "
"universally throughout the alien technology base. It's advanced stuff, "
"massively versatile and with a thousand possible uses.\n"
"\n"
"I think it warrants the research to see if we can reproduce this stuff in "
"our Workshops, but even if we can't, it seems likely we'll be getting our "
"hands on large quantities of it with every UFO we salvage. We'll definitely "
"be able to find new, human applications for it that will extend and expand "
