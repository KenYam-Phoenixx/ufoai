msgstr "The aliens' homeworld is a small planet orbiting the star Antares. They have evolved in a similar fashion as humans, developing from single-celled life-forms into organisms, then into amphibians, then mammals, and eventually developing the opposing thumb. Today, their technology has entered the fusion age, where the power of stars is harnessed in devices small enough to carry around. They have also discovered a form of faster-than-light travel, though an interstellar trip still takes years, and the crew must be put in stasis for the duration. In terms of technological advances therefore, the Antareans are a few hundred years ahead; in terms of society, however, they are several hundred years behind. Their society resembles the feudal system during Earth's middle ages. The Antarean King is the highest authority, and all defer to his will. The Antareans are a warlike species. They have already conquered several other worlds, enslaving their indigenous populations and, in the case of the Ortnoks, compelling them to fight for their cause. Now, the Antarean warlords have set their sights on Earth. But unlike the inhabitants of their previous targets, humans turned out to be an intellectual match for the Antareans. Earth may well prove to be a tougher nut to crack than the Antarean warlords had originally thought..."

They still tend to infiltrate easily through any known armor and lose their particle energy not before a penetrating distance of about 10 cm. Therefore a soldier hit by a tachyon charge suffers only minor superficial injury but is heavily wounded in his viscera. These properties of tachyon particles have been used to create devastating weapons that the aliens now use to terrorize humanity.

In particular, the recently analyzed charged plasma beams are reported to dissipate on the surface of the nano-material, consuming some of the fullerene fabric, but not passing through.

msgstr "The H-92 dropship is the main troop transport for the Phalanx rapid intervention forces. Powered by four General Electrics HM-5600 turbo jet engines, this dropship achieves a top speed of mach 1.0. The four engine exhausts can be pivoted so the H-92 has the ability to take off and land vertically. This technical feature is essential for rapidly deploying troops to any location worldwide. On the downside the H-92 has hardly no combat value because of only minor armament. Therefore Phalanx commanders always have some interceptors stading by for air cover if a H-92 encounters a enemy UFO."

This is significantly slower than many of the alien UFOs, but regarding the maneuverability the F-48 can easily compete with almost all of its adversaries. Like the H-92 dropship, the F-48 has the ability to take off and land vertically. Therefore many Phalanx bases have vertical shafts leading form the surface to the subterranean flight hangars.

The parts that are different are most likely genetically engineered because they do not show any individual variability. The fact that they are genetically altered and that they do not seem to have any functional reproduction organs suggests that they are clones made by some as yet unknown alien species. Additionally the Ortnoks have several cybernetic implants which involve mainly the cardiovascular system, the muscles, the eyes and the brain. They enhance the physical strenght and stamnia as well as the senses to a level superior to any human. The purpose of the brain implants is mostly unclear but it is believed that they serve as receivers for commands. But currently this is only a assumption because there is no evidence proving the existence of such a master-species."

Electrically stimulating the Antarean heart produces a smooth, four stroke heart beat that takes in blood, aerates the blood within the lungs, filters the aerated blood of pollutants and toxins through the additional organ, before pumping the blood around the body. This circulatory system must contribute greatly to the stamina of the species.DNA analysis of specimens of different rank reveals differences in the amount of junk DNA carried by each specimen. Specimens of a higher rank have noticeably less junk DNA, and it appears to have been replaced by DNA containing patterns that yield easily to mathematical modelling.
