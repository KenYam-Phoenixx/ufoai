"The aliens' homeworld is a small planet orbiting the star Antares. They have "
"evolved in a similar fashion as humans, developing from single-celled life-"
"forms into organisms, then into amphibians, then mammals, and eventually "
"developing the opposing thumb. Today, their technology has entered the "
"fusion age, where the power of stars is harnessed in devices small enough to "
"carry around. They have also discovered a form of faster-than-light travel, "
"though an interstellar trip still takes years, and the crew must be put in "
"stasis for the duration. In terms of technological advances therefore, the "
"Antareans are a few hundred years ahead; in terms of society, however, they "
"are several hundred years behind. Their society resembles the feudal system "
"during Earth's middle ages. The Antarean King is the highest authority, and "
"all defer to his will. The Antareans are a warlike species. They have "
"already conquered several other worlds, enslaving their indigenous "
"populations and, in the case of the Ortnoks, compelling them to fight for "
"their cause. Now, the Antarean warlords have set their sights on Earth. But "
"unlike the inhabitants of their previous targets, humans turned out to be an "
"intellectual match for the Antareans. Earth may well prove to be a tougher "
"nut to crack than the Antarean warlords had originally thought..."
