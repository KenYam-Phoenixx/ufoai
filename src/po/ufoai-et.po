Nende tulistamine hävitab enamus nende elutähtsaid osi. Et püüda hoverneti elusalt, peab hävitama Antareani kes hovernette kontrollib. Tavaliselt asub ta laeva kontroll ruumis.Need on väiksed, hõljuvad, mehaanilised, relvad kellel anti hüüdnimeks \"Hovernet\" nende poolt kes elasid üle esimese kokkupuute nendega. Nende nimi tuleneb 2 sõnast Hover - hõljuma ja Net - võrk. Nad hõljuvad maapinna kohal ja nad on väga ohtlikud, sest nad on relvastatud tachyoni snaiper püssiga. Arvatavasti on nad kaitsesüsteem mis aktiveerub kui UFO maandub või sunnitakse maanduma."

"Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"Our collected UN research files have yielded a lot of valuable information about weapon development done on Earth since the beginning of this century. One of the most interesting topics has been the production of DEWs (Directed Energy Weapons), weapons that transfer energy to a target by means other than a projectile. We are particularly interested in the files on Continuous Wave Lasers.\n"
"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers over the years, but no one has ever been able to create a laser that's man-portable and has a power output high enough to compete with ordinary firearms. Now, however, we've been given access to all this combined research, as well as whole libraries filled with the highest technology on Earth. I believe that not only can we make an effective man-portable laser weapon, we can make it into sizes previously unheard-of for a DEW.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we should pursue this research as soon as possible. Varying our arsenal will make it much more difficult to defend against, and our experience may lead us to develop viable aircraft lasers that could more effectively target high-speed UFOs than conventional firearms.\n"

"Commander, my team and I are happy to report our test weapons are living up to all our expectations, and I'm submitting a new set of blueprints to your system for a laser-based defensive facility. You will now be able greenlight them for construction.\n"
"\n"
"Here are the highlights.\n"
"\n"
"What we've done is we've stripped down our pre-existing SAM turret design and modified it to fit an upscaled deuterium-fluoride reaction chamber. We've beefed up the electrical systems to help amplify beam output, adding several megawatts to power and several dozen kilometres to effective range. The turret servos have been completely replaced with a computer-controlled mag-lev system to improve accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The result is that our new Base Defence Laser Turret is capable of tracking targets at any conceivable speed within Earth's atmosphere. It can lock on to targets almost instantly, and is powerful enough even at long range to damage UFO armour after only a few seconds of fire. Accuracy is good; the laser suffers much less from alien EW (Electronic Warfare) activity than missiles and can even predict basic evasive manoeuvres.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, as with any laser, range remains a problem. Atmospheric blooming limits effective range to only a few hundred kilometres. Weather effects and cloud cover can provide even more serious challenges and, in some conditions, could slash effective range by more than 50%. Lastly, the laser can only fire continuously for about 120 seconds before overheating comes into play, and it requires up to 60 seconds to cool down and recharge capacitors before it's ready to fire again.\n"
"\n"
"Despite these limitations, the Base Defence Laser Turret should provide an effective deterrent for most UFOs straying near our bases, and can provide assistance in shooting down alien craft at short range. It's going to be a good facility to have when one of our bases is in a pinch.\n"

"This is one of several proposals I'm submitting for the research and development of new laser weaponry. Each of these will have to be developed separately due to the size differences, power levels and complexity of the systems involved.\n"
"\n"
"Our CW laser program has been successful in miniaturising and lightening the necessary components for a powerful deuterium-fluoride reaction. However, the advances we've made aren't just useful for infantry weapons and small cannon. We want to prototype some of our upgrades in existing surface-to-air laser arrays, allowing us to track and fire continuous high-powered beams at a power level that our plants can comfortably handle.\n"
"\n"
"Given the various shortcomings of our SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles) against alien technology, I don't need to tell you all the advantages of having a direct-fire laser defence system. It won't be a full replacement for our missile installations, but it's definitely an avenue worth exploring in order to help defend our bases from alien incursions.\n"

"The subject is certainly alive, and we have put it through an extensive array of toxicology experiments which have provided vital data about its vulnerabilities to various chemicals and bio-agents. However, we have been completely unable to produce a behavioural analysis of the alien mind. This is because the specimen has showed virtually no signs of intelligence since its capture. It has done little more than eat, sleep, and stare at the walls of its containment unit. It responds to physical stimuli with reflex actions, aggression and/or submission, but we could not coax any information out of it. Even simple hand signals seem to be beyond the creature's comprehension. EEG monitoring reveals that the seemingly highly-developed brain registers virtually no brainwave activity at all.\n"

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"\n"
"In one experiment, an alien specimen was given a box of food, sealed by a two-digit number lock. The subject took six hours to find the right combination by trial and error. This places the alien's IQ well below most large terrestrial mammals; however, when other subjects in the Containment were given the same task, with exactly the same lock, they all immediately input the right combination on their first attempt without having been exposed to the first specimen's attempts. We know how this looks, Commander, but I assure you my team and I have been thoroughly conscientious about security and separation. The aliens have not been allowed to communicate in any way. We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about these events, though we're working on it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at best. Various ways of communication have been attempted without success. Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do not seem to speak or sign in any sense that we understand. Pheromone communication has had no effect beyond simple physical reactions. The large biological disparity between alien species also creates its own share of problems with containment and communication -- please refer to the alien autopsy reports for more details on individual alien physiology.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently working on teaching an isolated group how to express desire, acknowledgement and denial. Their intelligence is too limited to attempt anything more sophisticated at the moment. Once the subjects have mastered these basic concepts, we will have some data on the rate at which the aliens can learn, and a solid foundation upon which to build. Yamamura hopes we can gradually raise their communication skills until they can make themselves intelligible to us, thereby spreading this knowledge to others of their kind who may possess superior intellect and talents.\n"

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected 'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, if such experiments were to be approved by the Base Commander, I assure you that my team would take full precautions. Nothing is more important to us than the lives of our men and the security of our facilities.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"As you're aware, we are facing an increasingly worsening threat from the XVI virus. Over the past few weeks, DivIntel has been making a push into the areas in which the infection is most concentrated, in order to try and find some piece of intel that could help us understand how and why this infection spreads so fast from these focal points. I have been personally supervising the effort.\n"
"\n"
"It paid off this morning.\n"
"\n"
"Our reconnaisance teams have located what appears to be a camouflaged alien installation. The size and purpose of this installation is unknown, but we've established that it is located at the exact heart of an infection hot-spot. I harbour grave suspicions that this facility is directly connected with the lightning spread of XVI in the region. At this point it also seems likely there are more of these planetside installations, built right under our noses, serving as command centres and bases of operation for the alien threat.\n"
"\n"
"Dealing with these bases has to be one of our top priorities. I recommend we send a heavily-armed team to pay them a visit, a bit of reconnaissance-in-force. We need more information about the layout and purpose of the base, and the best way to do that is to capture it. We should eliminate all aliens at the location and, once we've secured the area and salvaged what we need, destroy the entire installation. This should constitute a significant blow to alien operations and restrict -- if not halt -- the spread of XVI in the area.\n"
"\n"
"Of course this mission will be highly dangerous. The base is right in the middle of an infection hot-spot, so the entire area is hostile territory. We may encounter anti-air ordnance and UFOs scrambled to the base's defence. A heavy escort will certainly be required. And . . . there's worse.\n"
"\n"
"Satellite imagery and recon flyovers have indicated that infected humans appear to be actively cooperating with the aliens. There's a good probability our unit will encounter human hostiles during the assault. This may not sit well with everyone, but if they open fire on our troops, we must be ready to respond in kind.\n"
"\n"
"That's all the intel I've got for you on this one, Sir. Good luck and good hunting.\n"

"\n"
"The work we've done on alien biology since the start of the invasion, along with some help from our captives, has put us on the track of certain psychotropic substances -- notably LSD-derivatives -- that have very interesting effects on alien psychology. The divergence of species has been a problem, as some compounds will work on one type of alien but not on another, but with this new data it will be an easy task to whip up drugs specifically tailored to the individual alien species.\n"
"\n"
"Subjects under the influence of this drug have proven to be more pliable and loose-lipped, as long as we keep injecting all the specimens in our containment unit. Unfortunately the hive mind's natural resistance to interrogation is still throwing a spanner in the works. Even with all our specimens fully injected, we've not managed to break that resistance, and the accuracy of our test information has still not been 100% reliable. All data we receive still requires some degree of time-consuming verification work.\n"
"\n"
"On the positive side, the act of getting the information out of our subjects has become quicker and more painless, which should speed up some of our research. The danger of allergenic reaction is much lower and the number of subjects succumbing during interrogation has dropped significantly. The deeper effect of the new drugs may even give us access to more sensitive information that we would not have been able to extract from the hive mind with our old serum.\n"

"As you may know, our efforts at communication with the live aliens in our Containment unit are progressing only very slowly. We're having a great deal of trouble applying our standard interrogation methods. The truth serum we have available has several distinct limitations; it tends to produce a lethal allergic reaction in most alien bodies unless we restrict it to smaller, insufficient doses, which worsens the serum's already incomplete effect on alien physiology. We've encountered numerous small lies and half-truths in the sessions we've taken so far. Torture has been attempted to influence this behaviour, but to no avail. Pain seems to have no corrective effect on the hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"There's also the larger hurdle of having to inject every single specimen of the hive mind in order to properly submerge any subject's sense of judgment. If one member of the hive mind dies, the remaining specimens' adrenaline-equivalent levels rise to the point where we have to start over.\n"
"\n"
"To this end, armed with our expanded knowledge of the alien mind and body, I propose a new research program to look into a universal set of sera that we can use to extract more reliable information, faster and more easily. There is obviously a great deal of information inside these specimens waiting to be seized, Commander; we just need the tools to properly crack the shell.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' -- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal -- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us in the fight for Earth.\n"

Are any of its systems still active or boobytrapped? What kind of materials is it made of? What dangers might it pose during storage or disassembly? All these questions and more need to be answered before we do anything further.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"Tulnukate rünnak Mumbais on meie situatsiooni teinud valusalt selgeks. Nende tehnoloogia on palju kaugemale arenenud kui meie oma. Okeaania Liidu sõdurite täielik põrumine püüdes vigastada ründajaid näitas elutähtsaid puudujääke praeguses sõjaväe väljaõppes ja varustuses. Nad kaotasid kolm pataljoni juba proovides tulnukate rünnakut tagasi hoida ilma silmnähtavat edu saavutades. PHALANX peab ületama need nõrkused ja selle jaoks on meil vaja kõige paremat saadaolevat inimeste tehnoloogiat.\n"
"\n"
"Excalibur Programm loodi, et leida kõige paremaid relvi Maal arvestades nende tootmisstandardeid, kasutatavust, kasutusandmeid ja nende toimimist lahinguväljal situatsioonides kus me oleme saanud tulnukatega lahinguid pidada.\n"
"\n"
"Prantslaste LeBlanc FAA-191 pakub kõige kasutoovamat laskekaugust, tulnukasoomust läbistavust ja salve suurust ründeautomaatide hulgas. Relva käepide on paigutatud relva keskele, salv ja kese on tagapool, et vähendada relva pikkust. See tulistab 30-kuulisest karpsalvest 4.7mm kestata laskemoona, volframtuumga terasest soomusest läbitungivad kuulid nii lühi- kui ka keskmisele kaugustele. Kuul ei ole efektiivne kaugvõitluses, kuid rünnakuautomaadid polegi selleks mõeldud.\n"
"\n"
"Kuigi relva disain on vana, esmaselt kasutatud 2057. aastal, pole ükski teine relv ületanud FAA-191-te. See on täpne ja kiiresti taaslaetav. Selle sitke ehituse tõttu võib selle peale loota lahingus ning see tõenäoliselt ei purune ega kiilu kinni. Relv talub kuumust, külma, tolmu ja niiskust. Laskemoona ja asendusjuppe on laialdaselt saadaval disaini vanuse ja populaarsuse tõttu. Selle relva kätte võib enda elu usaldada.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANXi kasutuseks oleme me andnud sellele relvale nime AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Soovitatav kasutus\n"
"\n"
"Sellest peaks saama meie parim valik keskmiste kaauguste lahingutes. See võib vabastada üllatavas koguses tulejõudu ja on surmav pikematel kaugustel kui ükski püstol või poolautomaat.\n"
"\n"
"Keegi ei tohiks aga hellitada lootust, et see ründeautomaat on kõikvõimas relv meie relvaarsenalis. Tasakaalustatud relvade valik on vajalik erinevate olukordadega tegelemiseks- kuigi AR-80 on ka hea relv lähitulistamistes, sellega on raske liikuda kitsastes käikudes ja paremaid tulemusi annavad poolautomaadid ja haavlipüssid, mis pakuvad suuremat kahju lühimaa tulevahetuses. Igal linnahoone läbiotsimisel peaks olema kasutusel lühimaarelvad kuni automaatidega varustatud sõdurid uurivad piirkonda läbi või moodustavad teise rünnakulaine esimeste toetuseks.\n"
"\n"
"Kui meie automaatidega varustatud sõdurid on olukorras, kus lakekaugusest ei piisa vastase tabamiseks, peaksid nad edasi liikuma pidevalt varju otsides, et tuua neid laskekaugusesse. Snaiprid peaksid pakkuma katvat tulejõudu või proovima vastast rajalt maha võtta.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Kokkuvõte\n"

"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in 2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"

"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW (Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create revolutionary new rocket types.\n"

"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"

"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"EM relva projekt on vilja kandnud! Esimest korda inimajaloos oleme me loonud rakendatava elektromagnetilise relva. Me oleme nimetanud relva Bolter relvaks, et mitte segi ajada seda teiste olemasolevate magnetiliste kiirendusrelvadega. Ma annan endast parima, et seletada relva tööpõhimõtet selles kokkuvõttes.\n"
"\n"
"Bolter relv kasutab rööbasrelva seadistust, mitte gauss-relva seadistust madala kasuteguri ja üldise nigela töötavuse tõttu. Rööbasrelvad kasutavad elektromagnetilist jõudu, et lennutada elektrit juhtiva kuuli mööda kahte juhtivat rööbast. Rööpaid läbiv elektriline vool tekitab magnetvälja nende vahele läbi kuuli. Magnetvälja suund on risti elektrivoolu suunaga, selle tõttu hakkavad rööpad ja kuul üksteist lükkama, kiirendades kuuli rööbaste peal.\n"
"\n"
"Maailma esimene suuremõõtmeline rööbasrelv ehitati 1970ndatel kasutas 500MJ hoiustatud energiat maailma suurimast ühe poolusega generaatorist. Nende relvade elektriga varustamiseks vajatav varustus on muutunud viimase sajandi jooksul kompaktsemaks, kuid mitte piisavalt väikseks või kergeks, et ehitana kaasaskantavaid relvi, mis vahetaksid välja kemikaale väljastavad tulirelvad. Teine suur läbikukkumine on nende suur haavatavus rööpa kulumise vastu. Rööpad kannatavad palju iga lasuga, mis nendelt lastakse ja kui kontaktid on raskesti kahjustatud ei saa elektrivool korralikult läbida rööbastelt kuuli. See põhjustab relva võimsuse kaotamist iga järgneva lasuga. Iga lask vajab vähemalt lühikest pikkust kulumata rööbast, et kiirendada.\n"
"\n"
"Õnneks oleme me leidnud probleemile lahenduse -- iga valangu järel uute rööbaste asetamine relva.\n"
"\n"
"Relva laskemoona eeltäitmise idee on kasutuses olnud juba pikka aega. Kuni praeguseni on see kehtinud vaid tavapäraste tulirelvadega, kuid me oleme välja töödanud uue põhimõtte- väike, eraldi vooluallikaga ja isoleeritud rööbas laetud iga lasuga. See annab igale lasule kasutatava puutepunkti ja lubab kasutada energiaks igaks lasuks. Kui kõik lasud kasutatavas torus on kasutatud ja seeda rööpad hävitatud saab sõdur eemaldada vana toru, lasta sellel kukkuda maha ja paigaldada varutoru. Siis võib ta asendada ka aku uute valangute tarvis.\n"
"\n"
"Kuulid on eriliselt valimistatud 3.2x40mm labadega ribad, pressitud suurtest volframisulami lehtedest. Nad on üliteravad, soomust läbistavad ning nad kopsatavad sihtmäris ägedalt. Nende ribade põhjustatud augud on mitmeid kordi suuremad nende endi suurusest.\n"
"\n"
"Selline laadimisviis muudab Bolter relva taaslaadimise aeglaseks ja kohmakaks ning salved suurteks ja kalliteks (uus toru ja aku igas salves) ja annab väikese laskemoonakoguse salve- 4 lasku igas torus. Teisalt peatab Bolter relv vastaseid efektiivsemalt kui ükski teine tulirelv meie käsutuses. Seda saab kasutada kui snaiprirelv või kui võimsa ründerelvana olenedes, kas lasta üksiklaste või neljalasulisi valanguid. See on väga mitmekülgne relv paljude kasutusviisidega, selle tõeline taktikaline väärtus tuleb välja kui me saame seda lõpuks lahinguolukorras kasutada.\n"

"Tulnukate rünnak Mumbais on meie situatsiooni teinud valusalt selgeks. Nende tehnoloogia on palju kaugemale arenenud kui meie oma. Okeaania Liidu sõdurite täielik põrumine püüdes vigastada ründajaid näitas elutähtsaid puudujääke praeguses sõjaväe väljaõppes ja varustuses. Nad kaotasid kolm pataljoni juba proovides tulnukate rünnakut tagasi hoida ilma silmnähtavat edu saavutades. PHALANX peab ületama need nõrkused ja selle jaoks on meil vaja kõige paremat saadaolevat inimeste tehnoloogiat.\n"

"Excalibur Programm loodi, et leida kõige paremaid relvi Maal arvestades nende tootmisstandardeid, kasutatavust, kasutusandmeid ja nende toimimist lahinguväljal situatsioonides kus me oleme saanud tulnukatega lahinguid pidada.\n"

"Lahingunuga on tahke, 26cm kang teravat terast, mida saab kasutada igapäevasteks tegevusteks. Relvana kasutamiseks on lahingunoa äär tugevdatud tugeva keraamikaga et anda sellele soomust läbistavad omadused ja tasakaalustatud, et seda oleks võimalik vajadusel kasutada ka viskerelvana. Sellel on ka täägirõngas vanamoeliste relvade torude külge kinnitamiseks.\n"
"\n"
"Lahingunoa kaasamine meie arsenali tõstatas palju arutelu. Mumbai õpetas meile, et isegi kõige paremates tingimustes nuga ei ole piisav relv tulnukate relvastuse vastu. Kui noaga varustatud sõdur isegi jääb ellu ning jõuab tulnukani ta peaaegu kindlasti tapetakse tulnukate vingete teradega, mis lõiguvad läbi soomuse. Ainult käputäiel kordadel on noavõitlejad suutnud noavõitluses ellu jääda.\n"

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"Commander, now that we've had a good look at the alien blade technology from several sources -- the Bloodspider's 'fangs' and the Kerrblade -- we're starting to form a picture of how to recreate the unknown or ill-understood materials used in their construction.\n"
"\n"
"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a razor, and yet shock-resistant and flexible enough to survive the stresses of melee combat. Once forged they are nearly impossible to break, nick or bend. Applying a hammer and chisel directly to the blade just means you end up with two neatly-sliced halves of a chisel.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously it would be of great interest to us if we could create our own knives made from these materials, with edges tapering to the width of a single molecule. My team and I believe it may now be possible.\n"

"If you give us the funding and lab time we need, we can design and create a new monomolecular combat knife that will even the playing field for our soldiers when forced into hand-to-hand combat. This knife will be far more compact than the Kerrblade and much easier for humans to wield, and it'll be small enough to be used one-handed.\n"

"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"

"The ADA 22's main drawbacks are its short range and its complex internals, which are difficult to repair. However, our experienced technicians should have no problem doing maintenance on this model.\n"

"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he will have very little warning and in most cases will require special training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are placed at risk.\n"

"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our troops. Its utility is not to be underestimated.\n"

"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more shrapnel than any other grenade on the market.

"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm -- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"For this project, we already had ready access to all the required technology. We've made very few changes to the general design of the grenade. The only real challenge was to shrink the complex machinery enough to fit inside a standard 25mm shell. We've had to scale back the power of the plasma grenade somewhat in order to do that -- the hydrogen core of our new 25mm shell is a fair bit smaller, emitting less plasma than the alien hand grenade. However, this is offset by the fact that it can be fired en masse from our HPGL Grenade Launcher over relatively long distances.\n"
"\n"
"We've dubbed our creation the 25mm PB ('Plasma Burst') Grenade. We can manufacture them by the box or by the speedloader, both of which will be extremely expensive to produce.

These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"

"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"

"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire consequences.

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close in terms of power.\n"

It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"

I believe you'll find the weapon's specs to your satisfaction.\n"
"\n"
"This rifle is possibly the most accurate weapon ever designed. It's light, rests easily in the shooter's hands, and the focusing lenses automatically correct the user's aim to help bring the beam on target -- and keep it there. It may inflict less damage per shot than its conventional projectile-firing counterparts, but it can do more over time if the shooter keeps the target in his sights. Eight troops with conventional assault rifles firing away at full-auto can easily miss a moving target. With laser rifles, that becomes a near-impossibility.\n"
"\n"
"It is quick to fire, has a good magazine capacity, no recoil, a respectable range and does away with many other issues that plague conventional firearms. It will never misfire or suffer a jammed mechanism. It will never blow up due to a fouled or bent barrel. It will never have problems with incompatible or faulty ammunition. It can suffer cracked lenses if subjected to severe mistreatment, but those are thoroughly shielded, set into shock-resistant foam and protected from the outside by a metal iris that only opens when the weapon is ready to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The laser rifle's biggest weakness is its inability to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons.\n"

"We've designed the rifle to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This gives it approximately two minutes of continuous wave fire before a new cartridge must be inserted. The cartridges can be popped out and left on the ground without risk of contaminating the area, but they will require special hazard disposal once the mission is completed.\n"

This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"Robotic or armoured aliens may be able to survive a beam for some time, even from a heavy laser, before their armour fails. It's recommended to engage these with several soldiers at once and concentrate fire in order to bring them down as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"It's also recommended that you not replace all our conventional heavy weapons with heavy lasers, Commander. We need a good balance of weapons to play to the strengths of our troops and to the weaknesses of the aliens. A varied arsenal is a healthy arsenal, and can't be easily defended against.\n"

"Thanks to the experience we've gained from our Continuous Wave Laser research, my team and I have figured out one or two possible ways to further amplify the damage output of our infantry lasers.

The result will be a strictly heavy-infantry weapon of about the same size and weight as our HPML Rocket Launcher.\n"

"We estimate that this weapon could be invaluable in a fire support role or as a direct-fire blockade breaker, capable of dissolving enemy strongpoints with powerful, pinpoint accurate fire.

Accuracy at range is generally abysmal in Earth-built heavy weapons, and they can be difficult to employ in situations where we need to avoid collateral damage. The heavy laser would avoid these issues altogether.\n"

"Commander, I'd like to report that we've successfully prototyped the new electrolaser design and have approved final plans for a production model. We can now begin to utilise it in combat. As per usual, I've written up the specs and deployment advice here for you.\n"
"\n"
"From a technical standpoint, the electrolaser works on almost the same principles as natural lightning. It pumps electricity through a channel of ionised air -- what we refer to as a 'plasma channel' -- that is more conductive than the air around it, allowing the electricity to arc all the way to the target and then earth itself, causing severe shock damage. This plasma channel is created by a short, high-powered laser pulse which causes the air to begin ionising\n"
"\n"
"Electrolasers are a tried and true concept on Earth. They have a history of use going back several decades as less-than-lethal weapons. At their most basic, they are a 'taser without the wires', but until now they've suffered serious limitations due to battery capacity and the power levels required to knock out a soldier in insulated body armour. For this reason they've only ever been developed practically as single-shot disposables and close-range civilian weapons. Thanks to the output of our deuterium-fluoride lasers and energy systems, though, we've been able to go a lot further than that.\n"
"\n"
"Our electrolaser can project a stable plasma channel at short to medium ranges, depending on atmospheric conditions, and deliver previously unheard-of voltages to the target. It is effective against both organic and robotic enemies. It can be toggled to different power levels depending on the needs of the moment, from a simple stunning shock to full-blown electrocution which can kill weaker targets outright. It loads standard PHALANX deuterium-fluoride cartridges, which provide enough juice for several shots even at the highest power settings.\n"
"\n"
"Now for the cons.\n"
"\n"
"The more powerful electrical systems and laser equipment have increased size and weight considerably compared to the stun rod, putting the electrolaser firmly in the Heavy Weapons category. Like all laser-based weapons it's affected by rain, fog, smoke and other conditions that thicken the air or release particles into it. Like all electric weapons, firing at airborne targets will produce limited results, unless they're close enough to an earthed object to allow the electricity to arc between them. In addition, any electrolaser needs the right kind of atmosphere to be able to create a plasma channel; taking them off of Earth could render them useless.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, no matter what the drawbacks might be, performance is light-years ahead of Dr. Connor's stun rod. I highly recommend we replace all stun rods currently in use with electrolasers as soon as humanly possible. For the sake of our troops, if nothing else.\n"

"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"When the aliens need a sidearm, they don't screw around.\n"
"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two 'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately 20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual for human use. Our soldiers will now be able to employ the plasma pistol in a combat scenario as they would any other weapon.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a ratio that neither PHALANX nor humanity can possibly afford. Even if it was closer to 10: 1 I still wouldn't fancy our chances. After all, how many of them are there?\n"

"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard human frag grenade.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to make the weapon much less effective.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have anything concrete.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an entrenched needler gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend anyone to try it, Commander.\n"

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to make the weapon much less effective.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have anything concrete.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an entrenched needler gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend anyone to try it, Commander.\n"

"Commander, I'd like to present you with the finished plans and prototype for our Coilgun.\n"
"\n"
"Combining an alien-inspired power pack and coil arrangement with some of our Bolter technology has solved many of the coilgun design's inherent problems. A hundred years ago, the energy efficiency of coilguns measured less than 2%; meaning, the energy of the projectile at the time of impact was less than 2% of the energy used to fire it. Even with today's technology coilgun efficiency is limited to single digits, but the alien Needler manages efficiency ratings as high as 70%. It may take us years to get to that level, but with the Coilgun we've developed something that is both practical and effective for the war effort.\n"
"\n"
"In order to get better acceleration out of the coils, we've created a new kind of ammunition, based on the aliens' needle alloy. In shape it's a fairly standard fin-stabilised penetrator inside a discarding sabot, but it's made from materials never before seen on Earth. Discarding sabot rounds are normally used for much larger calibres -- we've effectively scaled down an anti-tank round -- but the armour-piercing potential is phenomenal, higher than any other weapon we have. In fact, the Coilgun is now the highest-calibre infantry weapon on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"We've also incorporated a Needler-style holographic sight, making the Coilgun extremely accurate and comfortable to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of a coilgun as a sniper rifle are obvious. There's no rush of propellant to make noise, no muzzle flash spitting out light and heat. Unlike even our Bolter, nothing comes out the barrel except the bullet -- there's no spray of hot metal from the rails to light up the sniper on infrared. With nothing to reveal the sniper's position except the noise of the bullet itself breaking the sound barrier, it's possible to fire and stay undetected, even against alien technology. Best of all, ballistics tests confirm that it should be able to bring down most aliens in a single shot.\n"
"\n"
"Of course we've had to make some sacrifices -- high weight due to the coils and electrical equipment contained in the barrel, low ammunition capacity due to the high calibre, large and heavy magazines/power packs. Despite this, I believe the Coilgun should replace most of our SR-1 Sniper Rifles, as it's proving difficult for our conventional weapons to compete with new enemy armour designs.\n"
"\n"
"Keep the SR-1 in light sniper and anti-infantry roles and move the Coilgun forward as our main long-range threat. The aliens will come to fear it.\n"

"Commander, our brainstorms down at DivEngine have come up with an interesting idea based on the alien Needler technology. When combining the alien fast-changing magnetic generators -- and, even more importantly, their power source -- with human-engineered EM rifle technology, some amazing man-portable weaponry becomes possible. I'd hereby like to propose a new design for a coilgun in the role of a sniper rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler is a terrific weapon, but there are undeniable advantages to delivering one large slug compared to a number of smaller flechettes; greater stability in flight, better armour-piercing ability, and above all superior stopping power. There's a reason why our sniper doctrine calls for one shot to a kill, that the target should be dead before he even knows the sniper is there.\n"
"\n"
"To this end we plan to adapt the electromagnetic equipment and power source from the Needler to a larger barrel and a more human-friendly shape, as well as developing a new slug to maximise damage potential. The whole package together would be a significant upgrade from our old S-1 Sniper Rifle, more accurate than the Bolter and with far more kick than the Needler.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in particular.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese government. Production models were only trickling into government units by the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"

"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger.

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"

"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"Meie jõupingutused luua tulnukatevastaseid kemikaale, mida saaks efektiivselt kasutada lahinguväljal, on vilja kandnud. Üks agent on klassifitseerunud eriti märkimisväärselt võitluseks sobivana, ning on valmis juurutamiseks Teie nõusolekul.\n"
"\n"
"Kõnealune agent on segu pleegitajast, sinepigaasist, titaantetrakloriidist ja mitmetest teistest ebameeldivatest ühenditest, mille segu kohta on meil saanud tavaks kasutada nimetust \"LÄMMASTIK\". See on äärmiselt agressiivne agent, mis reageerib orgaanilise nahaga mitte tundide, vaid sekunditega. See reageerib intensiivselt õhuniiskusega, moodustades küllaltki stabiilse, mitmeminutilise kesvtusega, kontsentreeritud gaasipilve.\n"
"\n"
"Toime orgaanilistele kudedele on kalk. Isegi vähesel kokkupuutel naha või limaskestaga esineb raskekujuline ärritus, mille tulemuseks on hingamisraskused ja väljakannatamatu valu. Silmadega kokkupuutel võib tulemuseks olla pikaajaline või, arstiabi puudumisel, pöördumatu täielik nägemiskaotus. \"LÄMMASTIKU\" poolt põhjustatud valuaisting on seejuures nii akuutse ja repressiivse iseloomuga, et see kõrvaldab võitlusest peaaegu mistahes subjekti. Meie orgaanilistest tulnukatest vangid on kõik demonstreerinud äärmiselt rahuldustpakkuvaid käitumuslikke vastuseid; enamik katsealustest satub šokki ja kaotab kontrollitud motoorse aktiivsuse täielikult või peaaegu täielikult, kuni neile manustatakse valuvaigisteid ja LÄMMASTIKU-vastaseid ravimeid. Nende hingamisaparaadist ei ole mingit kasu agendi vastu, mille kopsudesse jõudmine ei ole vajalik.\n"
"\n"
"LÄMMASTIK on samavõrd efektiivne ka inimeste vastu. Testid vabatahtlikega näitasid, et isegi lahinguväljal karastatud sõdurid olid loote-asendise kägardunult maas, liikumatud ning vaevalt võimelised hingama. Kaks katsealust tuli kiires korras hospitaliseerida söövitava mõju tõttu kopsudele ning koevedelike erituse tõttu, kuid ma võin rõõmuga teatada, et mõlemad jäävad ellu. Sellegipoolest on soovitav meie sõdurid mistahes LÄMMASTIKU kasutamise paigast eemal hoida. Juhuks, kui mõni meie sõdur siiski sellega kokku puutub, oleme me lisanud vajalikud ravimid meie esmaabipakkidesse.\n"
"\n"
"Ainsaks kaitseks LÄMMASTIKU vastu on kogu keha kattev kaitserõivastus. Mistahes vaba nahapind või hingamisava on kahjustuseks piisav, ning tulnukatel ei ole seni täheldatud turvist, mis kaitseks neid taolise rünnaku eest. Mis puutub PHALANX-i agentidesse, siis kogu pead kattev gaasimask peaks pakkuma piisavat kaitset, kuna meie standardmunder ja -turvis juba katavad sõduri keha õhukindlalt.\n"

Tegemist on elektrilise astlaga, mis annab elektrišoki millele iganes, mis puurub vastu kahte selle tipus paiknevat elektroodi. Šoki intensiivsust saab kasutaja kergesti reguleerida. Kõrgema pingega šokid võivad tulnukate robotite süsteemid ajutiselt üleküllastada ja põhjustada nende väljalülitumist, kuid nii võimsad elektrišokid võivad orgaanilistele vastastele küllaltki surmavad olla. Ka liiga lähedale sattuvad inimesed võivad saada elektrilöögi. Seega on soovitav olla ettevaatlik.\n"
"\n"
"Võitluses kasutamine on lihtne. Sellega relvastatud sõdur astub tulnukaga lähivõitlusse ja viib elektroodid kontakti vastase naha või turvisega ning vajutab päästikule. Järgnev elektrilahendus teeb subjekti mõneks ajaks teadvusetuks või võitlusvõimetuks, isegi läbi turvise või paksu naha. Teadvusetuse kestus varieerub liigiti ja on individuaalne, sõltudes kokkupuuteviisist, ainevahetusest, vaimsest seisundist ja muudest asjaoludest. Paraku ei saa ma veel öelda konkreetseid parameetreid. Siiski, meie hinnangul on sellise elektrišoki järel rohkem kui piisavalt aega tulnuka ohutuks vangistamiseks.\n"

The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, with impressive armour-piercing capabilities and extreme damage potential. The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot at ranges of up to 40 metres. Just one shot. With regards to lethality at range, it outperforms even our laser pistol. The only good news is that the PB pistol is significantly less accurate than our lasers and produce too much of a kick to make repeated accurate shots.\n"

"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the required physical strength. The particles leaving the barrel move at a fraction of the speed of light, so they generate an unholy amount of recoil against the shooter.

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to take advantage of it.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting realisations. Obviously, the key to creating more effective mobile armour based on the alien suits lies in the direction of nanocomposites. This will require large amounts of carbon nanotubes.\n"
"\n"
"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, and trying to work them into a proper shape was even worse. Because of this nanocomposite armour has never been used except in high-cost vehicles such as aircraft and tanks, and then only in plating that requires minimal shaping or other work. The alien armour, however, uses carbon nanotube composites in abundance. It's our manufacturing processes that are holding us back.\n"
"\n"
"With the alien armour in hand and enough resources at our disposal, I believe that we can devise new production methods and shaping processes that will allow us to mass-produce shaped nanocomposite plates, finally bringing this technology into our reach.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or 'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, Commander.\n"

"Commander, we've recovered a suit of alien body armour from the battlefield. This armour has been a plague to our soldiers due to its very high resistance to various types of damage; aliens wearing it have shrugged off shots that would have torn their unarmoured friends apart. It's not surprising that we still haven't managed to cut it open to perform an initial survey of its composition. We should investigate the armour's weaknesses as soon as we can, and perhaps ascertain a way to adapt it for our own uses.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to perform up to its design spec."

"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble for whatever I say here. Just for the record, the bastarding SecDef can get buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base does get attacked, defending the CC should be a top priority, because without it we will be unable to put up any kind of effective fight until it can be repaired.\n"

"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"The old CC blueprints have been updated by our engineers to replace the ancient H-9000 mainframe and terminals with up-to-date holo-workstations and a fresh supercomputer installation. All other components are still viable and effective."

"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"

"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the Hospital immediately.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Small Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 small VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Large Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously the Small Hangar cannot house large craft due to size considerations.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Small Hangar is to house interceptors for the interception of airborne UFOs. Please refer to specific aircraft files to review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and 700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even hangar lifts.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close -- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"

"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"

"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility of sympathetic detonation.\n"

"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"

"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new aircraft.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN nuclear site register. At full capacity -- 10 grammes of antimatter -- just one storage facility will be containing the equivalent of nearly half a megaton of TNT. While this isn't much compared to modern thermonuclear weapons, it's enough to turn the entire base and everything inside to cinders in less than a second. It's difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but under the wrong circumstances, it can happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"I believe I've already stressed that this facility must be the most heavily-defended building in any PHALANX base, taking priority even over the Command Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap at the Antimatter Storage.\n"
"\n"
"Although this facility will be essential to our continued success in this war, it's going to be very expensive to build and operate due to the advanced tech and materials required. It may be necessary to hold off on building one until we're sure our budget can stretch that far.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, until we manage to build one of these facilities, we'll be completely unable to store or use any recovered antimatter. We can't just build up a pile of unstable, alien, possibly-damaged tanks of nuclear-level explosive. Everything we find will have to be destroyed for safety.\n"

Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage.

It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach 1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all over the world.\n"

"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"

"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"

"\n"
"Filed: 04 November 2026\n"
"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium wing mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing on my own authority.\n"
"\n"
"This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it."

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

msgstr ""
"Commander, I'm extremely proud to present you with the plans for our new interceptor, the Dragon. As you can see we've taken more than one page out of the aliens' book and the radical styling truly pays off.\n"
"\n"
"Incorporating new technologies from the ground up, the Dragon consists of an inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer skin of carbon nanotube-reinforced plastics. This allows it to mount two actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-fighting mobility than alien designs.\n"
"\n"
"The three-pronged fuselage is also inspired by the enemy, slicing through the air with remarkable grace. The upper two prongs can mount small retractable weapons, the bottom prong contains a medium-sized weapon compartment, and the central structure was designed to accomodate the main hardpoint -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the Dragon was named.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we can't afford to spend it on anything but our airfleet. That's why we should be careful about where we deploy the Dragon, and consider whether or not its deployment is really necessary in any given situation.\n"
"\n"
"Also, please note that while the Dragon is technically capable of entering orbit on its own steam, it has no space capabilities and should not be pushed above the upper atmosphere under any circumstances. Some things are just too much to ask right now. We're engineers, Commander, not wizards.\n"

"Commander, let me preface this by saying it's obvious that the aliens have been severely outperforming us in every way, but nowhere is this more evident than in the air. We were in a bad position at the start of the war and despite our efforts there has been little improvement.\n"
"\n"
"However, now that we have an understanding of alien materials and how they behave in the air, as well as alien engines and fuelling systems, I think my team and I are ready to tackle the task of creating an entirely new interceptor exclusive to PHALANX. We believe that by combining alien techniques with good old human manufacturing we can design something that will be vastly superior to our current-generation craft while remaining economically feasible to produce and to fly.\n"
"\n"
"The program will incur considerable expenses in lab time, personnel and materials, but as always we stand to gain much more than we could possibly lose. It's a project that could rally a lot of hope for our cause, Commander. Please let me know as soon as possible when you want us to start work.\n"

"\n"
"Here are the major technical details:\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft has only a small fuel tank and few provisions for a crew. It seems designed for little more than coming down from orbit, flying around a bit, and then returning.\n"

"\n"
"Beyond that the craft has no particular distinguishing characteristics.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manoeuvrable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a gunner and an electronics officer. The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm other craft in the same formation. This might not be true for larger craft, however.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and up to 12 aliens in a small passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't manoeuvre very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe will break up easily when hit. This is why a Supply Ship will often be protected by a large screen of Fighter UFOs, in case of interception.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if we can prevent any Supply Ships from reaching an existing alien strongpoint, we may be able to starve it out for a while before sending in troops. This may give us a crucial tactical advantage.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien medical technology. It makes only a few concessions to air combat. Its main purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry out hideous operations on human victims.\n"
"\n"
"Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood transfusion banks -- are geared towards the capture and alteration of complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem to be used to store some kind of heavy alien robot or cargo equipped with tank treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these robots in place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of air-drop mechanism as well.\n"
"\n"
"It's difficult to speculate exactly what exactly goes on in these UFOs with regards to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with the alien harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for that which do not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to suspect that the Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity on Earth. Something has changed. Until we fully understand what's happening, we need to prepare ourselves for what could be the worst threat to the global population we've ever seen.\n"
"\n"
"In the air the Corrupter's performance is relatively poor, being slow and sluggish compared to other UFOs, but from our observations it appears to be heavily escorted and presents a major ground threat due to its large crew complement and on-board heavy weapons. More than any other craft we've encountered, the Corrupter is purpose-built to deliver large alien forces to the surface solely to attack civilians.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, it's painfully obvious that we need to shoot these things down whenever and wherever we see them. If we don't, it's going to result in the wholesale slaughter of innocent people and possibly even scenes worse than Mumbai and Bonn.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"

"We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of heavy fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.\n"
"\n"
"The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. It seems like the aliens have actually adapted our design for their own use and may begin using different loadouts on individual craft. If the aliens are actually learning from us, we could be in for a hell of a ride . . .\n"
"\n"
"Even more interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the standard skin of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading UFOs. This new armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and various other substances designed to slow and stop projectiles from penetrating. The basic principle is simple enough but the new compounds have interesting properties which we're not sure we fully understand. I'll see if my team can make anything of it and, if so, I'll have a new research proposal ready for you soon.\n"
"\n"
"The fuselage design of the Gunboat is still ostensibly that of a spacecraft, but it has certain adaptations that make it much easier to handle in atmosphere. It has actual wing surface generating lift, unlike the small claw-winged designs which relied on brute engine power to stay airborne. Furthermore, mobile flaps on the wings and stabilisers -- much like on human aircraft -- allow the Gunboat to use the airflow over its surfaces, giving it a much tighter turning circle, a far higher angle of attack and a tremendous rate of climb compared to a UFO moving on engine power alone.\n"

"Overall the Gunboat is fast, manoeuvrable and utterly deadly. It seems to outperform previously-observed UFOs on every level; faster, tougher, better-armed and more nimble. The only positive is that it would take three or four times as much material to build a Gunboat compared to a small attack craft and twice as much fuel to keep it flying, so it's unlikely we'll see Gunboats in large numbers. My only worry is that they won't need very many of these to pound us into dust. Extreme caution is advised, Commander, and I recommend we spend some time and money upgrading our airfleet as soon as we can.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when full.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam weapon we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by matter-antimatter reaction rockets similar to UFO engines. These missiles are insanely fast, so fast that they don't need explosive warheads to kill their prey, relying solely on kinetic impact and the sympathetic detonation of any remaining fuel. More research into this weapon will be a high priority.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, and it would be wise to upgrade our equipment in order to mitigate some of the aliens' tech superiority.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots and craft on any Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous threats in the future.\n"

"Autopsy reveals that the creature is a complex robot without any organic components. Its body is reminiscent of the terrestrial spider; a central body housing the artificial brain and power cells, and eight legs driven by powerful servomotors that allow it to move across the battlefield at frightening speeds. It is equipped with razor-sharp mandibles which can dissect human victims on the spot and store tissue or whole organs in a large cavity located in front of the power cells. These machines have been recorded cutting apart live humans during a terror mission and storing their biomass for retrieval. The process is gruesome and very, very short.\n"
"\n"
"Our soldiers have dubbed the creature 'Bloodspider', and the name has stuck.\n"
"\n"
"Ballistics testing on samples of the Bloodspider's armour plating reveal that it is very tough and has excellent insulating properties, making it effective against a wide variety of weapons.\n"
"\n"
"-- The armour is highly resistant to lasers, electricity and incendiary ammunition, but it can be penetrated by high-velocity armour-piercing rounds.\n"
"\n"
"-- High explosives also achieve good results, as they tend to damage the vulnerable leg joints. This may be the most effective way to take these creatures out.\n"
"\n"
"The existence of this creature raises some frightening questions. It suggests that the aliens are taking a very personal interest in us, and they're not asking questions.

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the 'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in combat.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and it seems to have stuck.\n"
"\n"
"That's all I have for you right now, Commander. I'll contact you again as soon as something new develops.\n"

"Suured, ülearenenud silmad võimandavad tamanil näha pimeduses. Silmadel on mitu iirist, mis kaitsevad võrkkesta ereda valguse, nagu näiteks päikesevalguse eest, kuid äkilise ereda valgusesähvatuse korral ei pruugi iiris reguleeruda jõuda, ning tulemuseks võib olla pikemaajalisem või püsiv pimedaksjäämine. Meie pimestusgranaat võib siinkohal väga efektiivseks osutuda.\n"
"\n"
"Naha halli tooni põhjus on omamoodi huvitav. See tuleb ülivähese koguse räni eritusest, mis kõvastub paindlikul alusnahal, moodustades loomuliku kaitsekihi, mis kaitseb küllaltki hästi löögi ja kuumuse vastu.\n"
"\n"
"Analüüsi kokkuvõtteks võib öelda järgmist:\n"
"\n"
"-- Tamanid on loomulikult resistentsed kuulidele ja löökidele, kuid mitte niivõrd, et sellised relvad oleksid võitluses kasutud.\n"
"\n"
"-- Nende nahk hajutab väikese või keskmise ulatusega kuumutamist, kuid pikemaajalisem kokkupuude leegiheitja leegi või põleva kemikaaliga mõjub siiski. Laserid teevad neile tavalisest veidi vähem viga.\n"
"\n"
"-- Kuigi tamanite keha on nõtke ja elastne, on nende siseorganid löökide vastu kehvasti kaitstud, mis teeb neid eriti tundlikuks plahvatuste lööklainele.\n"
"\n"
"Täiendava uurimise tulemusena on kõrvale jäetud mitmeid ulmelisi teooriaid. Hoolimata tamanite ja inimeste suurest sarnasusest, peaaegu piisavast, et võiks eeldada mistahes seoseid, on pigem tegemist konvergentse evolutsiooni juhtumiga (kaks erinevat rada sama tulemuseni) kui sugulusega. Tamanite ja inimeste geenijärjestustes on väga vähe sarnasusi ning DNA kromatiini struktuur on tamanitel mitu suurusjärku keerulisem kui inimestel. See paistab välistavat hüpoteetilist ühist päritolu.\n"
"\n"
"Võitluses kujutab taman endast märkimisväärset ohtu. Nad on väga väledad ja võimelised kasutama mitmesuguseid relvi suure täpsusega. Lisaks sõduritele on nad tunukate sõjamasinavärgis ka mitmetes spetsialistirollides, milles tamanid paistavad olevat enamuses. Keerukamad relvad ja turvis on pigem tamanite kui teiste liikide kasutuses. See on tõenäoliselt kooskõlas nende arenenud ajude, meeleelundite ja tundlike sõrmedega.\n"
"\n"
"On raske öelda, kas tamanid on kunagiste UFO-lugude \"hallid\" või mitte, kuid see paistab ebatõenäoline. PHALANX ei ole seni leidnud kinnitust ühelegi tunukate tegevust kirjeldavale allikale alates 1950-ndatest aastatest. Praegu nähtud ufod ei ole kindlasti lendavad taldrikud. Kui nad oleksid võinud Maad vallutada sajandite eest, miks oodata kuni praeguseni? See ei paista mõistlik -- kuid teisest küljest, kes võiks teada mis võib olla mõistlik tulnukate jaoks?\n"

Küsimuste peale hüüdsid kohalikud lihtsalt \"xuRta AwmA\" -- mis tähendab hindi keeles 'kurja vaimu' või 'deemonit'.\n"
"\n"
"Tule all lühenes see kähku sõnaks \"taama\", ning tulevahetuse lõpuks oli see veelgi muutunud. Kõik olid hallide luupainajalike olevuste hakanud kasutama sõna \"taman\" (hääldusega 'tah-man'). See nimetus on endiselt kasutusel, kuid nüüd me võime kindlalt öelda, et need tulnukad on tehtud mitte tulest ja pimedusest vaid lihast ja verest.\n"
"\n"
"Esiteks, ja mis on tõenäoliselt kõige huvitavam, on selle olendi välimus peaaegu inimesetaoline. Kaks kätt, kaks jalga, kere ja pea; liigub kahel jalal; nägemis-, kuulmis- ja haistmisorganid kõik üldjoontes sarnastes kohtades. Subjektil kätel ja jalgadel on kolm pikka sõrme/varvast, millest üks (pöial) on vastassuunaline. Keskmiselt on see liik inimestest lühem ning nende tugevuse kohta petlikult kõhna kehaehitusega.\n"
"\n"
"Olendil on väga lihtne komplekt elutähtsaid organeid; süda, kopsud, maks jne. Enamik liigseid organeid, mis inimestel on evolutsiooni käigus säilinud, puuduvad. Bioloogiliselt on kõige huvitavamad siseorganid ja seedetrakt. Subjektil on kokku kolm seedetrakti, mis on mõeldud äärmiselt raskestiseeditava taimse materjali seedimiseks. Mistahes tüüpi liha seedimise võime puudub täielikult. Seega, kust iganes nad ka ei tuleks, on tamanid taimtoidulised. See leid on rahustanud põnevusejanulisemat osa meie personalist. Vähemasti me teame nüüd, et tulnukad käi siin meie liha järel.\n"
"\n"
"Suured, ülearenenud silmad võimandavad tamanil näha pimeduses. Silmadel on mitu iirist, mis kaitsevad võrkkesta ereda valguse, nagu näiteks päikesevalguse eest, kuid äkilise ereda valgusesähvatuse korral ei pruugi iiris reguleeruda jõuda, ning tulemuseks võib olla pikemaajalisem või püsiv pimedaksjäämine. Meie pimestusgranaat võib siinkohal väga efektiivseks osutuda.\n"
"\n"
"Naha halli tooni põhjus on omamoodi huvitav. See tuleb ülivähese koguse räni eritusest, mis kõvastub paindlikul alusnahal, moodustades loomuliku kaitsekihi, mis kaitseb küllaltki hästi löögi ja kuumuse vastu.\n"
"\n"
"Analüüsi kokkuvõtteks võib öelda järgmist:\n"
"\n"
"-- Tamanid on loomulikult resistentsed kuulidele ja löökidele, kuid mitte niivõrd, et sellised relvad oleksid võitluses kasutud.\n"
"\n"
"-- Nende nahk hajutab väikese või keskmise ulatusega kuumutamist, kuid pikemaajalisem kokkupuude leegiheitja leegi või põleva kemikaaliga mõjub siiski. Laserid teevad neile tavalisest veidi vähem viga.\n"
"\n"
"-- Kuigi tamanite keha on nõtke ja elastne, on nende siseorganid löökide vastu kehvasti kaitstud, mis teeb neid eriti tundlikuks plahvatuste lööklainele.\n"
"\n"
"Täiendava uurimise tulemusena on kõrvale jäetud mitmeid ulmelisi teooriaid. Hoolimata tamanite ja inimeste suurest sarnasusest, peaaegu piisavast, et võiks eeldada mistahes seoseid, on pigem tegemist konvergentse evolutsiooni juhtumiga (kaks erinevat rada sama tulemuseni) kui sugulusega. Tamanite ja inimeste geenijärjestustes on väga vähe sarnasusi ning DNA kromatiini struktuur on tamanitel mitu suurusjärku keerulisem kui inimestel. See paistab välistavat hüpoteetilist ühist päritolu.\n"
"\n"
"Võitluses kujutab taman endast märkimisväärset ohtu. Nad on väga väledad ja võimelised kasutama mitmesuguseid relvi suure täpsusega. Lisaks sõduritele on nad tunukate sõjamasinavärgis ka mitmetes spetsialistirollides, milles tamanid paistavad olevat enamuses. Keerukamad relvad ja turvis on pigem tamanite kui teiste liikide kasutuses. See on tõenäoliselt kooskõlas nende arenenud ajude, meeleelundite ja tundlike sõrmedega.\n"
"\n"
"On raske öelda, kas tamanid on kunagiste UFO-lugude \"hallid\" või mitte, kuid see paistab ebatõenäoline. PHALANX ei ole seni leidnud kinnitust ühelegi tunukate tegevust kirjeldavale allikale alates 1950-ndatest aastatest. Praegu nähtud ufod ei ole kindlasti lendavad taldrikud. Kui nad oleksid võinud Maad vallutada sajandite eest, miks oodata kuni praeguseni? See ei paista mõistlik -- kuid teisest küljest, kes võiks teada mis võib olla mõistlik tulnukate jaoks?\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing them out into our troops' sights.\n"

"Uut liiki tulnuka -- šhevaari -- lahkamine on olnud väga huvitav. Tegemist on märkimisväärse kõrvalekaldumisega humanoidsematest tamanitest ja ortnokitest, digitigraadsete jalgadega ja väikese sabaga. Lisaks sellele paistab, et olend on täiesti pime. Puuduvad silmad või muud valguse nähtavat spektrit töötlevad elundid. Seevastu paistab tal olevat teisi huvitavaid elundeid selle puuduse kompenseerimiseks.\n"
"\n"
"Esiteks, ševaar näeb välja nagu perversne inimese ja sisaliku ristsugutis. Erinevalt enamikest Maa sisalikest paistab tulnukas olevat soojavereline ning inimesega sarnase või veidi suurema ajumahuga. Tema massivsed jalad on üllatavalt vetruvad ja ta võib pikkade hüplike sammudega kiiresti läbida pikki vahemaid. Käed on suured ja ei paista tekitavat probleeme tulnukate mistahes liiki relvade kasutamisel.\n"
"\n"
"Lahkamise tulemused on ei ole vähem huvitavad. Rindkere avamisel selgus, et rinnakorvi esikülg on ühes tükis luukilp mis toetub jäigale kõhrele. Luud on samuti erineva ehitusega, koosnedes põhikomponendina mitte kaltsiumist vaid süsinikust metalli jälgedega, mis teeb nad eriti tugevaks. Noa või kuulidega on seda väga raske läbistada, ning veel keerulisem saab olema leida elutähtsaid organeid, mida vigastada. Mistahes luukattega kaitsmata osad paistavd koosnevat sitkest lihaskoest.\n"
"\n"
"Aju on eriti hästi kaitstud. Mitmekihiline sarvkude ümbritseb seda läbistamatu turvisena. Sellest piirkonnast leitud kulumisjälgede põhjal me oletame, et need tulnukad tegelevad regulaarselt jõulise peade kokkurammimisega. Väike luumassist esileulatuv segatuidulisuseks kohane suu viib lihtsasse kuid hästitoimivasse seedetrakti.\n"
"\n"
"Lisaks ajule ja suule on peas siiski veel elundeid. Luukurdude taga on kolmest organist koosnev kompleks, mis paistab tajuvat infrapunast kiirgust. See on ševaaridel ilmselt silmade asemel. Meil on alust arvata, et nende elundite tundlikkus on ligikaudu võrreldav PHALANX-i standardile vastavaid IP-prille kandva inimese nägemise tundlikkusega.\n"
"\n"
"Lahkamise ja lahinguväljal tehtud filmisalvestuste põhjal võime järeldada:\n"
"\n"
"- Ševaarid näevad infrapunases spektris. See komplitseerib nende eest varjumist või neile märkamatult lähenemist.\n"
"\n"
"- Nad kasutavad enamasti kergevarustust, et säilitada oma loomulikku liikumisvõimet. See võimaldab neil efektiivselt kasutada äkkrünnakutaktikat.\n"
"\n"
"- Ševaaride keha on väga vastupidav löökidele ja lõikamisele ning nende kompaktseid siseelundeid on raske vigastada löökide või lööklainega. Siiski pakub nende soomuseline nahk vähe kaitset tule, laseri ja elektri vastu.\n"
"\n"
"Ševaare kasutatakse enamasti kiirete turvistatud skautidena. Selles rollis on nad üliefektiivsed, kombineerides kõrge mobiiluse täiendatud nägemisvõimega, ning tulnukatel ei paista neist puudust olevat. Ševaarid paistavad ebamäärases tulnukate hierarhias olevat tamanite ja ortnokite vahepeal, täites mõnikord, erinevalt ortnokitest, spetsialisti- või juhatajarolle, mida tamanitega kooskasutamisel täidavad siiski enamasti tamanid.\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on this big damned cannon we brought back.\n"
"\n"
"We've always suspected that a real alien army would field more than just plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger. Though smaller and lighter than the Plasma Blaster, the PB cannon's recoil is out of this world. It can blast a full grown man clean off his feet in one shot. No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"
"\n"
"As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous steel and blow the target back by several metres. This is usually all that's necessary. A second hit will turn the buckle into a fist-sized hole, clean through. Our infantry armour will perform only slightly better, but deflection will help somewhat.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon's mechanics are quite simple, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"

"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the \"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be suicide\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

These materials are so strong and flexible that they can be used for almost anything. Their most promising uses, however, have been in aircraft design -- specifically armour.\n"
"\n"
"We've had an extremely difficult time shooting down UFOs thanks to the resilient outer skin of alien materials. Unfortunately we can't simply slap this same kind of skin onto our own craft because the alien materials are far too heavy. Our craft would struggle to even get off the ground. That needn't be the end of it, though.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, if you let us do some research on it, I believe we can come up with an armouring scheme that -- while it might decrease speed and increase fuel consumption a bit -- should give our aircraft a far better survival chance against the alien weapons during interceptions. According to our calculations, aircraft with this kind of armour could withstand several particle beam hits and still remain combat effective.\n"
"\n"
"It's a very promising possibility, Commander, one that definitely deserves investigation.\n"

"Commander, I've got some good news. My team and I have finished prototyping the alien aircraft plating project. Our new armour is now ready for full PHALANX production.\n"
"\n"
"This has been a difficult project from the start. We've faced several major challenges in designing equipment capable of bending the alien materials into the shapes we want, and 'programming' the materials to change when we want and how we want them to do so. Ultimately we overcame these problems, but then we had to deal with the natural limitations of the material.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of these alien materials is their weight. They are significantly heftier than modern human aircraft materials, and anything we make from them will suffer from the extra weight. The only way the aliens manage to keep their wingless UFOs in the sky is through overwhelming engine power. Airspeed, manoeuvrability, fuel consumption, maximum operational range -- all these will be negatively affected by putting alien materials onto our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"However, it's a sacrifice we don't seem to have any choice in making. Even a very thin skin of alien materials offers a substantial protective benefit, shrugging off hits that would turn our Polymer Aircraft Armour to paste. During air trials of the new armour, one of our own \"Sparrowhawk\" missiles -- which can bring down most Earth-built aircraft in a single hit -- failed to inflict significant harm to the test craft. I'm not even joking. We've got half an hour of compiled test footage that will confirm everything I just said.\n"
"\n"
"The new aircraft plating we've designed takes full advantage of these capabilities and shows the supreme toughness of the alien materials. The armour can take Particle Beam Weapon hits at point blank range without breaking up. For the very first time, our aircraft will be able to soak up tremendous amounts of damage and still keep flying like the aliens do. I wouldn't say we're quite in the same league yet, but we're getting there.\n"
"\n"
"It may only be feasible to use this armour on aircraft equipped with alien propulsion or otherwise upgraded engines, due to the increased weight and reduced speed and range. Still, even if that turns out to be the case, the new plating will be essential in keeping our current airfleet effective against the mounting alien threat. You and I both know the price tag of new aircraft, Commander -- we cannot afford to let any of our planes become obsolete.\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use them for any applications we might come up with. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"Commander, the alien sensor suite appears to be a very powerful set of passive and active scanning systems, including radar, lidar, magnetic and UV/infrared reception, and -- most interestingly -- a kind of detection unknown to us, but which seems to have far more success at detecting UFOs than anything we have.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll let us take the suite apart, I believe we can find out what everything does and how to operate it, and how to replicate most if not all of the alien detection equipment. It would be an immense boost to our defence efforts on Earth if we can get this technology working for us, and its long-term potential for spacecraft development is vital. There's no way we could build a viable space-capable fighter with human sensors.\n"

"The project on alien detection is complete, Commander. We now have a full understanding of the machinery, its controls, and the modifications needed for human use.\n"
"\n"
"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat survivability of our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, it's not the immediate uses that are the most important. These detectors are vital for any future PHALANX spacecraft. In space, without the support of ground radar, we're going to need the extra power very badly.\n"

"This is one of several proposals I'm submitting for the research and development of new laser weaponry. Each of these will have to be developed separately due to the size differences, power levels and complexity of the systems involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Aerial Laser Cannon is the largest and most powerful iteration of our new laser designs. Like our infantry weapons it'll be powered by deuterium-fluoride reaction, but on a much larger scale and amplified by the aircraft's on-board electrical systems. Several exciting ideas are being considered.\n"
"\n"
"As well as being the biggest, this may well be our most challenging laser to create. Any aircraft cannon will have to reach across several kilometres of atmosphere -- and therefore loads of atmospheric blooming -- with enough punch at the endpoint to cut into a UFO's fuselage. Those sorts of power levels have been achieved before with massive arrays mounted on jumbo jets, but never in a package small enough to make a jet fighter cannon.\n"
"\n"
"The finished product should be able to engage UFOs with bullseye accuracy at ranges well beyond that of the SHIVA cannon, and although damage may be low, we expect that the ability to keep continuous fire and pressure on enemy craft will be valuable in the days to come.\n"

"Please approve lab time and funding for this program when you're ready, Commander.\n"

"Commander, I've just finished my report on our latest laser program. We've successfully prototyped the new Aerial Laser Cannon and are ready to put it into production.\n"
"\n"
"We achieved what we set out to do: create a continuous wave, deuterium-fluoride-powered laser with megawatt-range output, capable of tracking and hitting UFOs at ranges of up to 5 kilometres. Accuracy is excellent, hampered only by enemy ECM (Electronic Countermeasures), and unlike in all our other weapons it is not affected by range. The laser proceeds in a straight line and crosses the distance between gun and target almost instantly. It's hard to miss with it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser rapidly loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At maximum range, 5 kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on the same spot to hole a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much time to wait for a kill. The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it strikes a good balance between damage and distance. Average damage per second at these distances is slightly less than the SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so than any of our previous weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for driving and pinning down the enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing up to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are both too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to large off-base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not need to keep laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like to recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our airfleet except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. Anything that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty keeping hold of the target with SHIVAs, so the laser offers a far better solution with nearly as much staying power.\n"

"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of 'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it into mass production. This will give us access to 7-missile racks capable of being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded \"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of 'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, and it's ready now. We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it into mass production.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" is mounted in 7-missile racks, which can then be mounted to the appropriate weapons hardpoints on our aircraft. The missile's range is far superior to any of the other weapons we have available at this time; it's effective out to twelve kilometres from the aircraft thanks to its unique guidance technology. It's also hardened against EMP to prevent it from being disabled electronically.\n"
"\n"
"The individual missiles weigh approximately 65 kilos. A fully-loaded rack is approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow. In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, tearing mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single round on the target.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air efficiency.\n"

"If the mission target is stationary or ground-based, these rockets will be ideal for softening up any defences and defenders before a tactical mission.\n"

It is fin-stabilised and powered by a cheap solid-fuel rocket engine, a civilian model which is also popular in amateur rocketry.

"Commander, the UFO we recovered was equipped with a very interesting type of weapon that we'd like to research right away. It seems to fire some kind of high-velocity particle beam; if we can master this technology, or at least adapt it for use on our own aircraft, we could make air engagements with armed alien craft significantly more survivable for our craft and pilots.\n"

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"All our aircraft come standard with high-tech targeting systems, but they still have an extremely difficult time tracking alien craft and holding missile lock. Alien electronics are too far in advance of ours for us to be able to realistically counter their defences. Our systems lose lock, get suckered by flares or decoys, or simply get shot to hell by the aliens' beam weapons.\n"
"\n"
"These are all problems that we have no clear solution for at the moment. However, what we can do is mount additional targeting equipment with purpose-built filtering software that our standard systems can't load. This package was specially built by my team using the latest, most accurate data on alien craft signatures and detection methods. It knows much more about the patterns and weaknesses of alien signals, helping to penetrate the wall of Electronic Warfare activity around an alien craft. This will significantly upgrade the accuracy of all weapons mounted on the carrying interceptor.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This upgrade has several effective purposes. It can help to improve the effectiveness of low-accuracy weapons systems on a single aircraft, it can be used in a fire support role assisting barrages of long-range missile fire, or it can be used en masse by whole flights of interceptors to bring overwhelming fire to bear on our enemies at all ranges.\n"

"We've determined that the modular equipment bays on our aircraft can be used to accept extra fuel reserves. By installing these special but very simple fuel pods, we can greatly increase the range of an aircraft by loading more fuel on board, and improve the craft's speed by allowing the engines enough juice to run on maximum all the way. It also lets pilots make far more liberal use of the afterburner, further upping the speed, allowing us to better compete with hostile UFOs.\n"

"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 20 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Having read Cdr. Navarre's report, Commander, I have to stress that our charter stipulates we must stop any and all alien activity on Earth. We can't afford to let some of it continue because it's just out of our planes' reach. If civilians were to die because the dropship couldn't quite make it, our image would be shattered and our funding may suffer the consequences. We should keep some fuel pod-equipped planes on standby to deal with distant incidents."

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build things we could never have attempted before.\n"
"\n"
"Alien Materials should now be available for use in production. Unfortunately, they require a lot of rare and expensive components, some of which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we could obtain the materials needed in quantities that would make non-trivial production possible. We'll have to salvage what we need off the aliens, because we won't be able to produce any of it for the forseeable future.\n"

"Commander, as I mentioned in my previous report, the UFO we recovered was plated with a highly interesting alloy which blends plastic and metal together into a single material. These materials seem to be used almost universally throughout the alien technology base. It's advanced stuff, massively versatile and with a thousand possible uses.\n"
"\n"
"I think it warrants the research to see if we can reproduce this stuff in our Workshops, but even if we can't, it seems likely we'll be getting our hands on large quantities of it with every UFO we salvage. We'll definitely be able to find new, human applications for it that will extend and expand our combat capabilities.\n"

"You need to read this right away. With your authorisation, we've performed several autopsies and done our best to examine the live prisoners taken on our mission against the alien sympathisers. The results are alarming.\n"
"\n"
"Do you remember the report I sent you about the first live alien specimen we captured? As you may remember, it lost all its intellect and became largely unresponsive without fellows to empower the hive mind. Prepare yourself, Commander: The human prisoners in our Containment unit exhibit the very same symptoms. They do not think for themselves. Their thought processes are firmly suppressed and supplanted by the alien hive mind through a process we currently fail to understand.\n"
"\n"
"We've run and re-run examinations and blood tests on these people ad nauseum, and there can be no mistake. The blood samples are full of foreign DNA. All these people are carrying something in their bloodstream -- a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge numbers, which appears to replicate like a virus when placed in an uninfected human body and rapidly takes over, enslaving the victim to the alien hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"These subjects run the gamut of the human race; there seems to be no preference for IQ or physical potential. We don't yet know how the infection takes root, but even a few of these organisms entering the bloodstream may be enough to infect and enslave an individual entirely. Not even our own employees are immune, as we discovered to our horror when we screened our base personnel.\n"
"\n"
"Our field agents remain clean, thank God -- just think if we'd gone into a combat zone with soldiers capable of turning on their teammates at any moment! -- but I fear we have found one conclusive result. It's Dr. Eisenhower, our Director of Administration. He's been away on business to the UN since last week, but we ran an older sample which has come up positive. We don't know when or how he was subverted or if he even joined PHALANX with honourable intentions, but it's clear he has acted as an alien spy for some weeks. Unfortunately we can't seem to find him at any of the locations he was scheduled to visit. Internal Security has taken charge of his workstation and is in the process of information control.\n"
"\n"
"Things are a bit hectic right now. Dr. Eisenhower's infection implies that other members of a hive mind -- human or alien -- were in close enough proximity to allow him to function at human intelligence. He could have linked up with our subjects in Containment, or a nearby alien cell, or even other infiltrators inside our base. Right now, we don't know. Quarantine procedures have been tightened to the absolute maximum, and we're rushing another full batch of tests on all our personnel. We're all frightened down here in DivBio. My assistant has been jumping at shadows all day.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, our attempts to infect other terrestrial life -- even intelligent vertebrates such as bottlenose dolphins and elephants -- have failed completely. This organism must have been engineered wholly or in part to specifically infect the human species.\n"
"\n"
"We've dubbed the organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like one.\n"
"\n"
"Really, what we're looking at here is a bio-weapon of unprecedented proportions. Instead of killing its victims it takes control of them with no option of resistance and -- at the moment -- no available cure or defence. The most humble and harmless civilian can be infected and, with the instant shared expertise of the larger hive mind, become an effective warrior for the aliens while reducing our numbers. When the aliens also supply them with weapons, we can see the true face of horror.\n"
"\n"
"I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish scenario for us. Our troops will undoubtedly be coming up against more and more human opponents during alien attacks on Earth. We may even find people crewing UFOs for the aliens. It's madness.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we must develop a vaccine against XVI as soon as possible. The danger of our soldiers and salvage technicians falling victim to the infection in the field is too great to ignore even for a moment, let alone allowing the general population to fall prey to this abomination. I hereby request your permission to start work on a vaccine immediately. Please, please respond at your earliest convenience.\n"

"\n"
"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"

"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
"\n"
"This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"

"\n"
"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I'm afraid this isn't a social message; I'm writing you because of our pressing need for more information. We at DivIntel have been doing our part with tracking, logging and double-checking all reported alien activity on Earth, but we're increasingly being faced with our lack of data about the overarching goals of the alien invasion. We have no means of anticipating the aliens' next move because we have no clue as to what game plan they're following. That's why I am submitting a new project for your authorisation.\n"
"\n"
"I intend to analyse more closely the patterns of alien activity on Earth, the intended missions and targets of UFO incursions into our airspace, and some of the finer details of our own research documents regarding the alien creatures and their technology. The bits and pieces of intelligence we've gathered so far are just pieces of a puzzle, but right now we have no clue how they fit together. The continual low-key incursions, the mysteries of the alien hive mind, the harvesting of human material . . . Somewhere in there lie the answers we need to unravel the aliens' overall goals and strategy for Earth and for humanity. If we can just put all the pieces together, we'll finally be able to see the bigger picture, as frightening as it may be.\n"
"\n"
"Naturally this project will require a certain amount of lab time and funding to build up a complete picture. It shouldn't set back our other research too much, and it will be an important part of formatulating new, more effective counterstrategies to the alien invasion.\n"
"\n"
"The proposal is in your queue, Sir. Please write back when you'd like us to start work.\n"

"Proposal\n"
"\n"
"TO: Base Commander, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"FROM: Col. Ingrid Falkland, Intelligence Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"DATE: %02i %s %i\n"
"\n"
"SUB: Proposal: Orbital UFO Activity\n"
"\n"
"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Let me begin by stating a few ugly realities.\n"
"\n"
"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid does come under attack, comms between PHALANX command centres and assets in the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever managed to score a hit. There are experimental laser and maser platforms which are too underpowered to put a dent in heavy UFO armour. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"
"\n"
"As you see, Sir, these problems can all be overcome, but we need to do some serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please lend your authorisation as soon as is feasible.\n"
"\n"
"With kind regards,\n"

"Technical Specifications: AR-80 Assault Rifle\n"
"\n"
"CLASSIFIED LEVEL YELLOW\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 20 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

#~ "I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our conclusions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into hostile atmospheres.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's neck.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

#~ "Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here is a summary of my report.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of this alien hardware.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for navigation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"

#~ "Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner workings.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"
