/**
 * @file ufotypes.h
 * @brief Cross-platform type definitions.
 *
 * For compilers that provide it, includes C99 inttypes.h for defining integer types.
 * For those that do not (e.g. MS Visual C), defines integer types with equivalent syntax.
 * Also defines float32_t, double64_t and bool_t, to match the naming convention used by integer types.
