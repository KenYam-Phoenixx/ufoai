			 * Because of the grid based nature of this game, each cell can have at most only ONE
			 * floor that can be stood upon.  If an actor can walk down a slope that is in the
			 * same level, and actor should be able to walk on (and not fall into) the slope that
			 * decends a game level.  BUT it is possible for an actor to be able to crawl under a
			 * floor that can be stood on, with this opening being in the same cell as the floor.
			 * SO to prevent any conflicts, we will move down a floor under the following conditions:
			 * - The STEPDOWN flag is set
			 * - The floor in the immediately adjacent cell is lower than the current floor, but not
			 *   more than CELL_HEIGHT units (in QUANT units) below the current floor.
			 * - The actor's stepup value is at least the inverse stepup value.  This is the stepup
			 *   FROM the cell we are moving towards back into the cell we are starting in.  This
			 *    ensures that the actor can actually WALK BACK.
			 * If the actor does not have a high enough stepup but meets all the other requirements to
			 * descend the level, the actor will move into a fall state, provided that there is no
			 * floor in the adjacent cell.
			 *
			 * This will prevent actors from walking under a floor in the same cell in order to fall
			 * to the floor beneath.  They will need to be able to step down into the cell or will
			 * not be able to use the opening.
