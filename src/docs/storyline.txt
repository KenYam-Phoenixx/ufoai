===============================
GENERAL: Overall metastory
===============================
The aliens' homeworld is a small planet orbiting the star Antares. They have evolved in a similar fashion as humans, developing from single-celled life-forms into organisms, then into amphibians, then mammals, and eventually developing the opposing thumb. Today, their technology has entered the fusion age, where the power of stars is harnessed in devices small enough to carry around. They have also discovered a form of faster-than-light travel, though an interstellar trip still takes years, and the crew must be put in stasis for the duration.
In terms of technological advances therefore, the Antareans are a few hundred years ahead; in terms of society, however, they are several hundred years behind. Their society resembles the feudal system during Earth's middle ages. The Antarean King is the highest authority, and all defer to his will.
The Antareans are a warlike species. They have already conquered several other worlds, enslaving their indigenous populations and, in the case of the Ortnoks, compelling them to fight for their cause. Now, the Antarean warlords have set their sights on Earth. But unlike the inhabitants of their previous targets, humans turned out to be an intellectual match for the Antareans. Earth may well prove to be a tougher nut to crack than the Antarean warlords had originally thought...

===============================
GENERAL: Rough story development
===============================
The game should progress in the classic fashion, first battling lone UFO's and responding to terror attacks. As time passes the UFOs will grow more numerous and stronger. The Antareans will also start establishing bases of their own from which they launch their ships.

Milestones in research towards the Antarean threat include but need not be limited to: studying a live Antarean, a live Antarean Commander, Antarean fusion technology, Antarean FTL technology, and logs from Antarean UFOs and bases.

At the end of the game, PHALANX launches a mission to destroy the Antarean mothership, which is parked on the dark side of the moon. The mothership is destroyed, and the alien invasion is over. However, Antares will eventually notice the communications from its war fleet have stopped, and come to investigate... But for the coming twenty years, Earth has time to prepare for their arrival.

Ufopedia entry: "Political situation before the invasion"
===============================
2084 - A time of relative peace has finally come to Earth. Old wars have been fought out, old borders have been broken and new ones esablished, and governments have stabilized. Former nations and super-nations have coalesced into major political powers and the remaining lone nations are working together closely. Prosperity is no longer a stranger to many of the peoples of Earth as it once was in the 20th century, and the population now trusts its leaders to maintain the balance of power and carry them forward into a tranquil, thriving 22nd century.

United Americas
Includes the former USA, Canada, Greenland, Cuba, Mexico and the nations of the Central and Southern Americas. After the USA's military activities across the world peaked in 2017, a more inclusive foreign policy in the years that followed was credited as the catalyst for integration with its neighbours and the formation of the Asian Commonwealth and Arab Emirates. The UA retain their lead in space exploration as a result of the explosion in private enterprise in this area over the past seventy years.

The Greater European Union
The European Union continued its expansion efforts through democratic means to include more and more nations located on the European continent or adjacent to it.
The GEU currently consists of the following countries:
Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, FYR Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
A heavyweight political animal, the GEU is a vibrant and often controversial source of political and social thinking. While it packs a punch, it is slow to manoeuvre in all its dealings owing to its bureaucratic infrastructure. Militarily powerful, second to the Asian Commonwealth in size, the GEU is now typically a neutral force, and has acted only defensively for the past five decades.

The Asian Commonwealth
Spanning China, Mongolia, Japan, the Indonesian archipelago, India and the smaller Asian nations. Art, architecture, manufacturing and finance have become the backbone of the Commonwealth's economic success. Advances in nanotechnology have helped the nations of the Commonwealth to retain their manufacturing prowess; demand for their skills has come from every sector, ranging from bioengineering to space exploration. Now the largest military force, 20% larger than that of the GEU, the Commonwealth also chooses to excercise its considerable muscle only in defense. Crucially, they are the quickest of all the nations into action, thanks to the organisation of their military into smaller functional units and a wider teaching of rapid reaction techniques throughout their forces.

The Arab Emirates
Composed of the countries in the middle east, including Israel.
<TODO>list some of the countries (maybe even newly merged/splitted ones)
With dwindling oil reserves restricted to pharmaceutical use by international agreement, and the World's energy crisis solved by successive Russian breakthroughs, the Emirates were forced to find a new source of income. They have turned to their one remaining, vast resource: sand. Advanced glass technology has driven crystalline art and architecture to an unprecedented height. More importantly, and with the notable exception of intense, time critical computation that now relies on diamond based microprocessors, the worldwide demand for computational power has been satiated by the construction of cheap, sprawling silicon processor farms that rise out of the deserts from which they are made.

The African Union
A rising political and economic power spanning the entire continent of Africa and its islands. With Europe's dwindling religious convictions, Africa has become the new seat of the Roman Christian Church, with the pontificate established on Madagascar. In the face of all the sceptics, the Church established social order, paving the way for economic growth, and political weight. Though still heavily dependent on Australia to feed its population, this dependency is rapidly dwindling.

Russia
Russia rediscovered and revived its beleaguered engineering and scientific communities, establishing itself as a powerhouse of great insight and accomplishment in these fields. Russia is revered throughout the world for its advances in energy generation, transport and medicine. Such advances have brought with them a greater political voice and international support.
<TODO> maybe add some details about the vast amount of resources located in russia that have not yet been used (e.g hard to mine until now).

Australia
In 2024, the Australian government agreed to host experimental terraforming work, a joint effort of NASA, the ESA and the ASA, deep in the outback. Originally funded as part of a Martian exploration programme and eventually aborted, ten years of fruitless research suddenly gave rise to a rapidly expanding antipodean oasis spanning most of the continent. Now, Australia acts as the major food supplier to the African Union and parts of the Asian Commonwealth. Exports of shrimps and barbecues are at an unprecedented high.

Ufopedia entry: "The alien invasion"
===============================
The aliens first appeared on March 9th, 2084. Scientists discovered repeating patterns of unusual spikes in the high electromagnetic spectrum, as well as several other types of radiation. They would have little time to investigate the cause.
Our first contact with the alien menace occurred on March 12th, 2084. Without provocation, the aliens launched an attack on the Commonwealth metropolis of Mumbai. It is believed they singled out the densest population on Earth. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their life in the attack. Several people who are believed to have been in Mumbai at the time of the attack are still unaccounted for today. Eventually, Commonwealth forces managed to fend off the alien threat, but not without sustaining severe losses.

Nobody knows where the aliens come from. An attempt at diplomacy was made, but was met with force. Forty-eight hours after the initial attack, all seven political blocks declared a state of war. For two weeks, the armies of Earth tried to fend off the alien attackers, but they scored precious few victories. The United Nations, in accordance with the seven blocks' petition, authorized the creation of a specialized combat unit: PHALANX.

Charged with countering the alien threat, this combat unit is funded by all seven of the political powers, and draws its soldiers from the elite of their armies. Whether PHALANX is able to face up to the challenge remains to be seen...

... the invasion begins ...

[intro_sentence3]
It is during this time that the aliens invade Earth. They launch an attack on the city of Mumbai, it being the most densely populated area on Earth. Hundreds of thousands of innocent citizend are killed before the aliens are finally driven off by Commonwealth forces.

PROLOG

[prolog_sentence2]
Welcome, Commander. You have been given command over PHALANX. Your mission: protect the citizens of Earth, and avert the alien threat. How you accomplish this is up to you, but know that failure is not an option.

[prolog_sentence3]
Your first order of business is to set up your headquarters. Choose the location wisely, because it will have great influence on the success of the PHALANX project.

[prolog_sentence4]
A recent analysis of the attack on Mumbai revealed that around that time alien sightings increased in the most densely populated regions of Earth, including the central parts of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. You should consider increasing your field of operations to include these territories.

[prolog_sentence5]
Once you have established your first base, you must prepare your soldiers. The recruits that were transferred to PHALANX must be assigned to your craft, then equipped for battle.

[prolog_sentence6]
And don't forget to protect them as well. A live soldier kills more aliens than a dead one.

[prolog_sentence7]
That is all, Commander. Good luck.
