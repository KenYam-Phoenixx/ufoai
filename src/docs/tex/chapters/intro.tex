\section{Intro}

\subsection{UFO:AI - the beginning}
The original engine development was done as an extreme modification of IDs famouse Quake 2 engine by a team around Herby (see credits in the appendix) in \textbf{????}. After \textbf{??} years people lost interest on the project while additionally Herby didn't had the as much time at his hand as in the early days.
To prevent that all the work already invested till that stage (tech demo 2) is lost he took the offer of one of the former contributors (Mattn) to make it open source.  Since those days the source code is hosted by sourceforge.org and given to the community which is asked to use this chance to resurrect one of the most unique and influential games ever. After a short time it became clear that the interest in supporting the development of UFO:AI was unbroken and a bunch of volunteers found together to add their flavour and skill up to what you have in front of you nowdays.

\section{Free games / the community}
This game is brought to you by the UFO:AI Development team and its countless contributors. All of them share at least one thought: to make UFO:AI a great free % Link / footnote -> free as in freedom
 game. Besides detailed legal implications, mentioned in the following section and given in the appendix, most of all this means that every piece of code used to create this game is publicly available. Even more: you are free - even wanted - to change everything you want by yourself whenever you feel you can help making UFO:AI a better way to waste time. This may start with typos or end with complete mods or patches - it's up to you. With UFO:AI being an open-source development by a bunch of non profit orientated people this does also mean there is no big company in the back to pay for extensive testing, balancing or hardwarechecking. So whenever you encounter a bug, a hardware incompatibility or any other problem it would be a fair gesture to give something back to the community - even a carefully filled out bugreport helps a lot. So we hope to do our little share to promote free software and build up a productive open-source gaming community. And no matter what kind of skills you call your own, if you are a coder, 3D-moder, map-designer, even film-script writer, musician, concept-art designer (all of these made UFO:AI what it is today) be assured that there is a project out there waiting for your help - enriching the pool of free software.
