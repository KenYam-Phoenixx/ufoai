Contain script to generate a "spacial" base dir from the default base dir
Go to UfoAI root dir and run
src/resources/base_android.sh
It will generate three files - 0base.pk3 (multiplayer-only with 6 small maps),
0music.pk3 and 1base.pk3 (required for single-player).
All big textures will be resized to 256x256.
