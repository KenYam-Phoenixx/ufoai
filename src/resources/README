Contain script to generate a "spacial" base dir from the default base dir
Go to UfoAI root dir and run
src/resources/base_android.sh
It will generate three files - 0base.pk3 (multiplayer-only with 6 small maps),
0music.pk3 and 1base.pk3 (required for single-player).
All big textures will be resized to 256x256 to save space and device RAM.
You should upload that .pk3 files to some public HTTP server, for example SF.net,
then update the variable AppDataDownloadUrl inside file build/projects/AndroidAppSettings.cfg
and rebuild .apk file.
