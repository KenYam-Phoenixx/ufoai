Contain script to generate a "spacial" base dir from the default base dir
Go to UfoAI root dir and run
src/resources/base_android.sh
It will generate four files - 0base.pk3 (multiplayer-only with 6 small maps),
0music.pk3, 1base.pk3 (required for single-player) and i18n.zip.
All big textures will be resized to 256x256 to save space and device RAM.
You should upload that .pk3 files to some public HTTP server, for example SF.net,
then update the variable AppDataDownloadUrl inside file build/projects/AndroidAppSettings.cfg
and rebuild .apk file.
The ufoai-template.apk is configured to download these files from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsdl-android/files/UFOAI/
you may wish to re-upload them if you release new version (mattn, geever and bayo should have write access).
