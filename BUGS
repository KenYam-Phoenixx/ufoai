Known bugs in UFO: Alien Invasion 2.1.1
=======================================

1. Reaction fire settings are not being remembered from mission to mission.
   You can select reaction fire with a desired firemode in one mission, and
   your selection will be displayed in following missions as if the
   selection were active, but the game will instead use the weapon's default
   reaction firemode.
   To make sure your desired reaction firemode is active, you will need to
   reselect that firemode beginning of a mission.
2. Under unknown circumstances a soldier may use default firemode for
   reaction fire instead of desired and selected one. This bug is very rare.
3. Plasma Blade weapon is not removed from the hand after throwing it.
4. The Alien Shevaar model is clipping slightly into the ground when killed.
5. The Alien Shevaar model is not able to use armour in multiplayer - 
   putting armour on the actor will make it disappear.
6. Living Quarters base facility provides space up to 32 employees while
   the description says 20.
7. The amount of workers being used in production process is not being taken
   into account.
8. In rare cases, no message or mail will appear when a research project is
   finished. However, the time on the geoscape will stop.
9. Inventory bugs in multiplayer gaming - under certain circumstances,
   moving an item between containers (including hands) may result in leaving
   a duplicate (but unuseable) item in the source container. This may result
   in blocking that container for the remainder of the game.

If you have problems with UFOpedia texts please make sure you have correct
language settings in your system as well as in the game. Take a look at our

problem.
