Known bugs in UFO: Alien Invasion 2.1
=====================================

1. Reaction fire settings are not being remembered from mission to mission.
   You can select reaction fire with a desired firemode in one mission, and
   your selection will be displayed in following missions as if the
   selection were active, but the game will instead use the weapon's default
   reaction firemode.
   To make sure your desired reaction firemode is active, you will need to
   reselect that firemode beginning of a mission.
2. Plasma Blade weapon is not removed from the hand after throwing it.
3. In certain circumstances, newly-researched equipment won't be shown in
   the Buy/Sell menu. The workaround for this is to go back to geoscape,
   enter the base again and reopen the Buy/Sell menu.
4. Alien Shevaar model is clipping slightly into the ground when killed.
5. Living Quarters base facility provides space up to 32 employees while
   the description says 20.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
